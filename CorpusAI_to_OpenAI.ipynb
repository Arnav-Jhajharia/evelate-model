Corn, soybean, and small grain fields were readily\\nidentified. Because of the homogeneity of the signature within crops\\n(the result of favorable weather conditions), it was not possible to make\\nfurther differentiations, particularly in soil drainage classes.\\nANALYSIS OF SOIL WATER\\nSoil water content is one of the principal parameters correlated to\\n+\\t the crop signatures. Its value is monitored throughout the growing season\\nl•\\non each site.\\n1\\nD8\\nW6\\n-A.:\\nY+\\ni\\n9\\na\\'.\\nv\\nFigure 3.

A pre-\\nferred expression is water per unit volume of soil. This is a better\\nevaluation of the soil water content since it takes account of soil tex-\\nture and structure. Hawever its computation requires a correct measure\\nof the soil bulk density, which introduces some error due to soil vari-\\nability and requires a lengthy laboratory analysis. Table 2 gives the\\noven dry and 0.3 bar soil bulk densities for most of the ground data soil\\nsites. Values in parenthesis seem questionable.\\nAnother expression of the soil moisture is the available water,\\nwhich is the moisture retained in the soil between the field capacity\\n(a pressure of 0.3 bar) and the Permanent wilting coefficient (15 bars).\\nValues are usually expressed on disturbed (crushed, artifica lly packed)\\nsamples because it is easier and faster to do so. However, such measure-\\nments eliriii:ate the soil structure effect and have to be applied with\\ncaution to field situations, particularly for low natric potential (wet\\nend of soil noisture range).\\nA method was developed to measure soil water retention or) undis-\\nturbed soil cores. Soil cores are sampled using a hydraulic probe, sat-\\nurated with water, frozen, installed in a special holder (Figure 4),\\nmounted on a diamond saw, and cut to the thickness of the rubber ring\\nused in the pressure chamber.\\nIf the sawin g_ prodoces a \"polish\" on the faces, the sample surface\\nis roughened on a grinder covered with a medium sand Raper to reopen all\\nthc: . ores..W,\\nD10\\nco\\nr-M a m rn M icodr`+\\nM rlrir1r-I`-\\'r-{ r)r1\\n..t0\\n^Iv\\nNIV\\nr1N\\nri*0\\nriM\\n4n\\n4M\\nr1M\\nr4v\\nrl\\ndr..\\nCI\\nr-1M\\n4r^1\\nriN\\nr-IM\\n4O\\nr IM\\n4M\\n4N\\n4N\\nr1N\\nrL1\\nAN\\nri\\nw\\'COM\\nr4to\\nH\\nr4wr-1\\n4NM\\nr4drO\\nr INM\\nrir^\\nN\\nr1drN\\nr-INM\\nr1\\nN\\n^M\\nN W Ln r-i M 60 M H v M\\nO r4 r4 rl rl `-\\' ri r-j 4 rijrg\\nrd\\n00d\\'\\nMO\\nU1\\nr-Icodr\\nr-10.0\\nr-IR\\nR^r1r1\\n`^\"1l-%N\\nrl1\\n1cotfI\\nHO!11\\nr-I\\n>•I t04U\\n..\\nthMIwLnMMr1InNvMNNvtovr-1l0fVdr\\nUl C7 N rl r 4 r4 r4r; rl rl rl 4\\ndto\\ny+\\n\\' jw\\nHn\\nHM\\nr^\\n ri^\\nr4ro\\nriv°\\nr1der\\nric^tr\\n4^\\nrlx^\\n•^\\nQIa\\nCiN\\nr-1\\n^dr\\nf.0\\nr1N\\nM\\nr-1O1\\nM\\nril72\\nM\\nr-iG1\\nH\\nria,\\nM\\nriN\\nd\\'\\nr-1O\\ndr\\nr-1t^\\nto\\nr-1\\nN\\np MNtpGld\\'Mdrd\\'\\n1 r♦r--I .-! r-1 ... rl rl r1 r-1\\n^11\\nT\\nW \\'\\nC^\\n•\\t ^\\nU\\nA\\nr3\\nHdr•r1\\nH\\noEn\\nDCDo\\nri\\ncan..to\\n4J\\na..t11\\nO\\nN..\\nO\\nA0\\nvOri\\n}^\\nN\\n^-1v\\n7^1\\n&C-111\\nr-1\\nv\\n4h\\nul\\nD•r9\\ntick\\nll^\\nT\\t nil\\nFigtire 4.

The\\ndifferential values are statistically highly significant (p < .001) at\\n0.3 bar, but they are riot significant at the .05 level for the 3.5 bars\\nsamples (.05 < p value < .10). Therefore, water retention at 0.3 bar\\nshould always be measured on undisturbed samples.\\n11TTENiPT TO UEVFLOP REAL TIME AGRICULTURAL VA IAGEMENT\\nThe development of timely recommendations for crop and roil manage-\\nr-tont was an initial objective of the project. It appears that this Jb-\\njective cannot presently be acconnlished using Landsat data. The acqui-\\nsition of imagery re quires a long delay of at least two months.

As a result, the poorly drained soils\\nhad some moisture excess which probably will be reflected in the LANDSAT\\ndata.\\nAs a result of the wet season, the percentage of cloud cover was\\nalso higher than usual. This greatly reduced the availability of LANDSAT\\nscenes. There are only 3 scenes available with less than 10% cloud cover\\nfor the study area. There is no usable scene available from June 6 to\\nSeptember 20, 1979.\\nCorn leaf reflectance does not show a strong relationship witL>, plant\\nstress or plant water potential as measured with the technique used for\\nsoybeans in the 1978 greenhouse experiment. Additional measurements will\\nbe made in 1980.\\nHail-damaged areas show a characteristic signature on the LANDSAT\\nblack and white infrared product. Further identificaion will be tested\\nusing the digital data.\\nInformation extraction from the 1977 digital tapes was performed at\\nthe Eros Data Center using the IMAGE 100 and the IDIMS systems. The\\nstudy of one site showed that crop identification is feasible using tem-\\nporal signatures. But because of uniformly excellent crop conditions,\\nreflected in nearly homogeneous signatures, it was not possible to make\\nfurther differentiations, e.g., soil drainage classes.\\nTo evaluate more accurately the soil water content of the ground\\ndata sites, their soil bulk densities and soil water retentions at 0.3\\nJr ^hw.•3.;..^,^...,-..._..__WiJSin... l.+.A:s....o .^i.a. .tv.. ^^ e. ^^n.......t-...a. ...z.. .4^.\\t ..\\t .a\\n•\\nI[. .\\nD18\\nand 15 bars were measured.

The UCB Study\\nThe study concerns itself with variations in temporal-spectral\\ncharacteristics for a given crop. The primary objective was to\\nmeasure and quantitatively describe the year-to-year variation in\\ncrop temporal-spectral response patterns due to any year-to-year\\nvariation in the physical environment.\\nIn order to determine the yearly variation in crop tempova\\'1-\\nspeotral response, it was necessary to develop a measuring systent\\nwhich is acquisition independent. One way this can be accomplished\\nis by estimating a continuous spectral response curve for a crop\\nas a function of time. From such a curve, one can determine major\\nspectral events (spectral biostages) for a crop (e.g. maximum\\namplitude of a vegetation indicator, date of first green canopy\\ndetection) snd assess the year-to-year variation in such events.\\nThe function used to generate the continuous temporal plot is\\nF TB1 e82 T2 + B3\\nWhere F = the value of the green vegetation indicator (GRABS), T = day\\nof the year, and B1, B2, B3 are coefficients estimated by a least\\nsquares procedure. This particular function was chosen for its appro-\\npriate shape and its adaptability by logarithmic transformation to\\nestimation by least squares linear regression. However, estimation\\nby least squares linear regression proved to be unsatisfactory\\nbecause there is no obvious variance term to associate with a\\ntemporal-spectral value derived from such a segment -average curve.\\na\\nI. Hay, C.M., et. al., Annual Progress Report, Space Sciences Laboratory,\\nUniversity of California Berkeley , November 1979.\\nIn addition, the curve fit is extremely poor in some cases. For\\nthese reasons a nonlinear least squares program was developed to\\nestimate the coefficients of the function. For each wheat field,\\nthe following variables were calculated from the equations generated\\nby the nonlinear curve-fitting_ program.\\nF max = maximum GRABS value\\nTmax day of maximum GRABS\\nT \\tday of first detectability\\nT  = day of harvest\\nThe corresponding average values for each segment-year were calculated\\nby taking the unweighted arithmetic mean over al Vsampled fields\\nwithin that segment-year. These values are represented by the curves\\nin the accompanying graphs.\\nB. The Data\\nThe data set was prepared from Landsat MSS data and the segments\\nwere selected on the basis of: 1) the number of years of Landsat\\nand ground truth data available, 2) adequate within-year acquisition\\nhistories, 3) diversity in number of drought stress years, and 4) geo-\\ngraphical diversity. The MSS data was sun angle and haze corrected,\\nand a green vegetation indicator was calculated for each pixe l.,. Wheat\\nfields in specific segment-year combinations were then randomly sampled.\\nGround truth data was available for all the segments in years\\n\\'77 and \\'78, but of the segments plotted only 1851 had ground truth\\nin \\'76, For those segment-years in which ground truth was not available,\\nthe wheat fields were identified by analyst interpretation.\\nIII. CALCULATION OF CURVES\\nThe curves illustrated in the graphs were derived using a pro-\\ncedure common to the entire data set. The data consists of twenty\\nthree sets of the following variables\\nT1 = date of first detectability\\n_F1 = GRABS threshold for detectability (=2)\\nT2 = date of peak GRABS\\nF2 = peak GRABS\\n_._.t\\nF\\t,^\\nf\\t T3 = date of harvest\\nF3 = F1 (=2)\\nThese variables are essentially x and y coordinates for three points\\non a curve. Using these values for T (day of year) and F (GRABS)\\nalong with the function\\nr\\tF = Tel eB2 T2 + B3\\none can solve for a system of three equations and three unknowns\\nusing gaussian elimination.\\nGeneral Form: Ax = b\\nln(Tl)*Bl + (T1) 2*B2 + B3 = ln(Fl)\\nln(T2)*B1 + (T2) *B2 + B3 = ln(F2)\\nln(\\'T3)*Bl + (TV *B2 + B3 = ln(F3)\\nExample: For segment 1175, year \\'76 (see Table 1.2), the following\\nwere mean values over 15 fields:\\nThe System to be solved isr \\t-T1=40.87 \\tT2=95.55 \\tT3=165.36 \\tFl=200\\tF2=18.00 \\tF3=2.00 .\\n3.71040*Bl +--1670.35681*62 + 1.00000*B3 = 0.69315\\n4.55965*B1 + 9129.80273*B2 + 1.00000*B3 = 2.89037\\n5.10812*Bl + 27343.92969*B2 + 1.00000*B3 = 0.69315\\nThe Solution Vector is:\\nBI = 4.95862 \\tB2 = -0.00027 \\t B3 = -17.25308\\nAn arbitrary number of values for F can now be generated for arbitrary\\nvalues of T.\\n2\\nF  = Ti61 e62 Ti + 63 \\ti=1,30\\nPlotting F  versus T i yields the desired curvefor this particular\\nset of T1, T2, T3, F1, F2, F3. This procedure can similarly be\\nextended to plot the remaining data. It should be noted that the\\ncurves represent mean values for the fields within a given segment-year.\\nJudging from the standard deviations (see Table 1.2) of the parameters,\\na profile curve for an individual field within a segment-year wi1T likely\\nvary considerably from the mean profile curve for that segment-year.\\na\\ni\\nIV, CONCLUSIONS:\\nUCB concluded that the curves show no significant correlation\\nbetween the spectral variable Finax and any of the temporal variables.\\nThis result denies support to ideas lasserting that the relative\\nearliness or lateness of a crop\\'s development affects the value of\\nits spectral peak. However; significant correlations were observed\\nbetween Tmax and T  and between Tmax and T a.

INTROP CTION\\nIn any cost-effective stratified sampling design, the optimal sample size and\\nits allocation between the different strata depend on the within-stratum vari-\\nances, the stratum size, and the precision required for the estimate. With\\nthe development of an area sampling frame, strata sizes are known in terms of\\nthe total number of sampling units per stratum. The precision goal is fixed\\nin advance and hence known. However, prior to the survey, no direct knowledge\\nof within-stratum variances is available; therefore, it is necessary to esti-\\nmate them. Usually, a pilot survey is conducted and, subsequently, the infor-\\nmation resulting from the pilot study is utilized in planning a full-scale\\nsample survey. In this report, a methodology for indirectly estimating stra-\\ntum variances using existing agricultural statistics and other ancillary\\ninformation is proposed and evaluated for the U.S. Great Plains (USGP).\\nIn most countries, crop statistics are computed annually either through com-\\nplete enumeration or by employing sample survey methodology. However, the\\ngeographical level and the type of crop statistics reported vary considerably\\nfrom one country to another. For example, reliable crop statistics for area,\\nyield, and production are available in the United States at the county level.\\nIn contrast, crop statistics are not available for China at a political sub-\\ndivision level lower than the country level. Canada, India, and several other\\ncountries provide fairly reliable annual crop statistics at a geographic level\\nsimilar to the U.S. county. Yet, even among these countries, the type of crop\\nstatistics produced is varied; for example, in Australia, annual crop statis-\\ntics contain no information on harvested acreage. Consequently, no fixed\\nprocedure can be applied to each and every country for determining the within-\\nstratum variances.\\nInitially, in the Large Area Crop Inventory Experiment (LACIE), a proportional\\nsample allocation based primarily on historical wheat production was employed.\\nThat is, a fixed total sample size was allocated to the different countriesof\\ninterest and to the smaller political subdivisions within each country so as\\nto be proportional to the historical wheat production of the different\\n1-1\\'\\ngeographic subdivisions. In the later phases of LACIE, methods were devised\\nto estimate the within-stratum variances by utilizing past Landsat imagery and\\nother ancillary data. These estimates permitted amore nearly optimal sampl-\\ning allocation to be employed during the final phases of LACIE.\\nDuring the first year of concentration in a crop/region, little to no previ-\\nously analyzed Landsat data are avail-,able for making within-stratum variance\\nestimates; this will be the case in many crop/regions of the Agriculture and\\nResources Inventory Surveys Through Aerospace Remote Sensing (AgRISTARS) pro-\\ngram. Thus, a technique is needed for making initial within-stratum variance\\nestimates without the use of previously analyzed Landsat data. The descrip-\\ntion and the evaluation of such a technique are presented in this report. The\\ntechnique is motivated by the empirical models employed by Perry and Hallum\\n(ref. 1) in their study on sampling unit sizeG Also discussed in this context\\nare the methodologies employed during the LACIE to estimate the within-stratum\\nvariances for sample allocation in the crop survey program of the Earth Obser-\\nvations Division (EOD), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),\\nLyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC). Other information included in this\\nreport are the following. The approaches adopted in LACIE Phases I, II, and\\nIII and in the Transition Year (TY) are described in section 2. Details of\\nthe proposed technique are given in section 3. Different variations of this\\nprocedure as applied to estimate refined-stratum variances for wheat in the\\nUSGP are given in section 4.1. [Refer to Chhikara (ref. 2) for details of the\\nstratification considered in this study.] A discussion of the stratum-\\nvariance estimates obtained using the different methods is given in\\nsection 4.3. It is concluded in section 5 that if reliable historical crop\\nacreages are available at a small political subdivision level (e.g`., county in\\nthe U.S.), then fairly good stratum-variance estimates can be obtained using\\nthe proposed method.\\nThe technique for making initial within-stratum variance estimates is designed\\nto make optimal use of the available data (even if limited by its reliability)\\nfor estimating within-stratum variances on crop/regions that otherwise would\\nnot be estimated because previously analyzed Landsat data are not available.\\n1-2i\\n2. PREVIOUS ^PPROACHES\\n2.1 LACIE PHASES I AND II\\nDuring Phases I and 11 of LACIE, the total sample size was determined primlr\\nily by engineering and resources constraints. Kowever, sample survey metho-\\ndology [the Neyman Optimum Allocation Formula (ref. 3)] shows that, if\\nallocation of the total sample to the different strata were made proportional\\nto the respective product of stratum size and within-stratum standard devia-\\ntion, the resulting crop estimate should have a minimum variance for a fixed\\noverall sample size. Thus, for a cost effective design, knowledge of within-\\nstratum variances is required.\\nIn order to estimate the within-stratum variances used as input into the\\nNeyman allocation formula, i,he binomial model was assumed where the sampling\\nunit had dimensions of 5 by 6-nautical miles (a segment). That is, if p is\\nthe crop (wheat/small-grains) proportion for a stratum, then 5(1\\tp) is a\\nrough estimate of the between-segment crop proportion variance for the stra-\\ntum. That this model overestimates the within-stratum variance for all strata\\nwas recognized because the model assumes that every segment is entirely wheat\\nor nonwheat, which is far from reality even in the new lands of the Union of\\nSoviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.). However, it was considered reasonable\\nto assume that these estimates reflected the relative magnitudes among the\\ntrue within-stratum variances. Hence, it was thought that the total sample\\nwac utilized in a cost-effective manner. It was recognized that an optimal\\noverall sample size could not be determined using a binomial model because of\\nconsiderable positive bias in the variance estimates produced by the model.\\n2.2 LACIE PHASE III\\nFor this period, greater emphasis was placed on achieving a more accurate crop\\nacreage and production estimates. As a result, a decision was made to\\nreallocate the sample segments in the USGP for \\'LACIE Phase III. Among other\\nfactors, this decision was based on the desirability of having more reliable\\nwithin-stratum variance estimates as input variables to the allocation formula\\n2-1\\nthan could be obtained from the binomial model. It was noted that the sample\\nunits were large and could be expected to contain some nonagricultural areas.\\nAlso, it was envisioned that if the segment crop area were related to the\\nsegment agricultural area, then this statistical relati;;nship could be\\nexploited to produce an improve- within-stratum variance estimation proce-\\ndure. This, in fact, proved to be the case. The resulting within-stratum\\nvariance estimation technique was derived using the following approach.\\nThe crop proportion in a sample segment was expressed as\\n(1) p ra\\nwhere\\np the proportion of crop acreage in a segment\\nr = the ratio of crop acreayf^ to agriculture acreage in a segment\\na = the proportion of agricultural acreage i on a segment\\nIt was assumed that the ratio r did not depend on the proportion of agricul-\\ntural acreage in a segment. Then, the variance of p was easily computed using\\nthe formula for the variance of the product of two independent random\\nvariables. For each stratum, this yielded the following formula.\\na2 = ar [E2 (a) +,22\\nJasE2(r)\\t (2)\\nThe mean and variance of the proportion of agricultural acreage, E(a) and\\naa, respectively, were obtained directly from estimates of the proportion of\\nagricultural land in each segment in a stratum. The available Landsat imagery\\nwas used for this determination. However, it wa: not feasible to obtain\\ndirectly such information for the variable r. Instead, the mean and variance,\\nE(r) and a r2,, were estimated for each stratum \\'as follows: E(r) was estimated\\nby\\nr =\\tHistorical crop acreage for stratum h \\t(3)h\\tLandsat agricultural acreage for stratum\\n2-31\\nand yr by\\nar = Krh(1 - rh)\\t\\n(4)\\nwhere K = 0.03\\nThe value of K in equation (4) was based on an empirical study for small\\ngrains where the mean and variance of r were computed from segment data\\nobtained from Landsat imagery for 40 counties in the USGP. These counties\\nwere considered as strata. Then the stratum variance was modeled by\\nor = Kr(1\\tr)\\t\\n(5)\\nwhere r was the mean ratio of crop acreage to agricultural acreage in the\\nstratum. A least-squares fit of this model resulted in K = 0.03. The adjust-\\nment, K, to the binomial variance, r h(1 - rh), reflected the departure from\\nthe assumption that the ratio of crop acreage to agricultural acreage in .a\\nsegment was 0 or 1. Thus, the determination of 6r from equation (4) could\\nonly be regarded as approximate and tenuous. Accordingly, the resulting stra-\\ntum variance estimate was\\nSP = 0.03 r h(1 - rh) (52 + Sa) + Sash\\t (6)\\nwhere a and S2:a were the mean and variance of the proportion of agricultural\\nacreage in a segment, respectively, and where this proportion was determined\\nby using Landsat imagery for the stratum. The properties of S p2 could not be\\ndetermined for several reasons. The most obvious reasons were the empirical\\nnature of the derivation and the historical nature of the input data. Never-\\ntheless, for initial ;;;thin-stratum variance estimates, this model was\\nexpected to be an improvement over the binomial model considered in Phases I\\nand II of LACIE.\\n2.3 ,TRANSITION YEAR (TY)\\nThe method of computing initial stratum variance estimates for use in the TY\\nproject was influenced by two developments. First, a geographical stratifica-\\ntion based on agrophysical characteristics had been developed for the TY sam-\\npling design (ref. 4). Second, sample data from LACIE Phase II in the form of\\nsegment wheat and small-grains proportion estimates were available for use in\\ndirect estimation of the stratum variances. Although these sample data did\\nnot constitute a random sample relative to the new stratification, it was\\ngenerally assumed that estimates based on these data would be more reliable\\nthan those obtained by using the earlier indirect methods. However, for some\\nstrata, sufficient segment data needed for directly estimating the stratum\\nvariance were not available. When this occurred, the stratum variance was\\n`\\t estimated indirectly by employing the approach used in LACIE Phase III. The\\nnonrepresentative nature of the sample data used in the direct estimates and\\nthe use of two altogether diffe rent methods of estimation could have led.to\\ninconsistencies among the stratum variance estimates. If true, this would\\nhave adversely affected the associated sample allocation.\\nAn evaluation of the TY sample allocation was performed using the LACIE\\nPhase III sample segment estimates. Phase III segment estimates were used\\nbecause they were available and were regarded as more reliable than those from\\nPhase II. The evaluation indicated an underalloc,ation of sample segments to\\nsome strata and an overallocation of sample segments to other strata. For\\nfurther details, refer to Chhikara (ref. 2). However, in reference 2, the\\neffect of the nonrepresentative nature of the LACIE Phase III segment data\\nwith respect to the TY strata was not considered.\\nFor samole allocations in the future program of AgRISTARS, it would be ideal\\nto have reliable and representative Landsat segment estimates in order to make\\ndirect initial estimates of the stratum variances. However, it is not expec-\\nted that initially such data will be available for most countries of interest.\\nAccordingly, some indirectly derived stratum-variance estimates will need to\\nbe determined for the purpose of making a sample allocation. The approach\\n2-4^a\\nr\\nrused for LACIE Phase III seems reasonable and feasible except for the deter-\\nmination of the variance of the ratio of crop acreage to agricultural acreage.\\nA new procedure for obtaining initial stratum crop proportion variances is\\noffered and described in section 3. The procedure is equally applicable to\\nestimating the stratum variance or.\\n3. PRESENT METHODOLOGY\\nA procedure for indirectly estimating the stratum variances used in an initial\\nallocation is presented. There are three basic underlying ideas. First,\\nobtain estimates of the stratum variance for a set of sampling unit sizes\\nincluding both large and small size sampling units; second, establish\\nempirically a relationship between the sampling unit size and the stratum\\nvariance; and third use the empirical model to obtain an estimate of the\\nstratum variance for the desired sampling unit size which is a segment.\\nIn the context of crop estimation, Smith (ref. 5) and Mahalonobis (ref. 6),\\nindependently of each other, proposed that the stratum between-units variance\\ncould be modeled as a power function of the sampling unit size. Histori-\\ncallys a number of empirical studies [Smith, Mahalonobis, Jessen, Hansen\\net al., and Asthana (refs. 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, respectively)] strongly indicate\\nF\\tthat the power function provides a simple, yet satisfactory, mathematical\\nmodel for the functional dependence of the stratum between-units vari?r, \\ton\\nthe sampling unit size. The first application of this functional form\\nspecifically to the between-units crop proportion variance was made by P. C.\\n.Mahalonobis (ref. 6) in his 1938 study of jute production for Bengal (India).\\niHe considered the following function for the stratum between-units crop pro-\\nportion variance.\\na2 = ^( l\\t\\nx\\t(7)\\n(bx)g\\nwhere p is the stratum crop proportion and x is the sampling unit size. The\\nsample sizes considered in this study were 1, 2.25, 4, 6.25 1 and 9 acres.\\nThe:ratiovale behind the variance formulation in equation (7) is as follows:\\nwhen x\\t 1 , the variance a1 b2 =\\t- /\\tx\\tp (\\tp) and 1/b represents the largest area\\n(e.g., crop field) for which the crop proportion is either O or 1. As x\\nincreases in size away from 1/b, the denominator in equation (7) increases and\\nax decreases with P (i\\tas an upper bound. If it is assumed that fields in\\na stratum are not mixed and all fields are approximately of equal size, the\\n3-11\\ni\\n.r\\ndifference between the average fiFld size and the sampling unit size being\\nconsidered should be indicative of the decrease in ax from P (1 - P); a\\nsmaller decrease in a 2 is expected with a smaller difference between the\\nsampling unit size and 1/b. Consequently, the bias in estimating ax by\\nwill be smaller for the smaller size sampling unit, and it is zero\\nwhen the sampling unit size is less than or equal to 1/b.\\nThis same model was employed by Perry and Hallum (ref. 1) in their sampling\\nunit size study. Their study was based on the LACIE Phase III ground-truth\\ndata set and concluded that indeed the power function does provide a\\nsatisfactory model for the between-units wheat acreage (or proportion)\\nvariance for sampling unit sizes ranging from 171 to 25 426 acres. Several\\nother studies, particularily those by Jensen (ref. 7) and Asthana (ref. 9),\\nshow this;,general relationship to hold reasonably well even for very large\\nareal units, a county for example.\\nThe relationship in equation (7) can be rewritten as\\na2 = axsx\\nwhere\\nx = the sampling unit size\\naX = the stratum crop proportion variance corresponding to x\\nand a and 6 are parameters to be empirically determined for each stratum.\\nIn developing this model for the different strata, it would be ideal to have\\nknowledge of a 2 over a wide range of sampling unit sizes, x. For most coun-\\ntries, this is not feasible because it would require expensive sampling or\\ncomplete enumeration to be performed, thus defeating the purpose of employing\\nthe model in the first place. Therefore, one is led in least-squares estima-\\ntion of the stratum parameters a and S to choose sampling unit sizes for\\nwhich a2 can be estimated directly from existing agricultural statistics or\\ncan be mathematically modeled and then estimated from existing agricultural\\nstatistics.\\nE\\t3-2\\ns(8)\\nIn the U.S., crop statistics are available at the county level and a strataum\\nnormally consists of many Counties. Thus, the between-counties variance can\\nbe easily computed and used as an estimate of stratum variance corresponding\\nto a sampling unit approximately equal to the average county size. However,\\nsince the counties often vary considerably in size, the stratum variance\\nshould vary statistically as the s,3im, piing unit size varies from the smallest\\nto the largest county. This stafisL;cal variability may be preserved by using\\na one-point estimate of a2 for each county in the stratum. The one-point\\nestimates are obtained as follows. Consider the county as a sampling unit\\ni my in a stratum\\nacreage for the i th county in the stratum\\nacreage in the stratum\\ns\\nXi = (pi - P)2\\t (9)where\\nxi = the size of the i th co\\npi = the proportion of crop\\nr,\\tP = the proportion of crop\\nThen the squared deviation\\nprovides an estimate of a2 for the sampling unit size x i. Although these\\ni\\ncounty level estimates can be expected to provide guidance in estimating the\\nstratum variance for a sampling unit approximately the size of a county, they\\nalone can not be expected to be sufficient to predict the stratum variance for\\na sampling unit of the size of a LACIE segment since it will be outside the\\nsampling wilt size range for the counties.\\nThe next three estimates are developed for use with small sampling unit sizes.\\nAny one of these estimates along with the one-point variance estimates from\\nequation (9) is used for the least-squares estimation of the parameters a and\\nS. The resulting regression curve is evaluated for the sampling unit size of\\ninterest (segment) to obtain the corresponding stratum variance estimate.\\nLater, it will be observed empirically that the last two relationships provide\\n\\'fairly reliable stratum variance estimates.\\n3-3\\nl\\nFirst, suppose that all fields are of the same size and shape and the sampling\\nunit is randomly placed with the exception that it intersects only one field.\\nThen the stratum variance corresponding to the field size, x 0, is given by the\\nbirumial variance\\na2\\tn(1\\tn)\\t (10)\\n0\\nwhere 7 is the proportion of the fields belonging to the crop type of inter-\\nest. For a fixed crop proportion p and a fixed sampling unit si-e, the\\nbetween-units variance is maximized when the sampling unit proportions are all\\neither 0 or 1. Thus, equation (10) provides an upper bound of p(1 - p) for\\nthe stratum variance regardless of the sampling unit size. This feature and\\nthe method, in general, are illustrated in figure 3.1.\\nSecond, in a Lansat type sampling process, the sampling unit is randomly\\nlocated and is expected to intersect more than one field. Thus, a closer\\napproximation to a2 than that given in equation (10) is desirable. An exact\\n0\\ndetermination of the variance a \\tis not feasible. However, a realistic\\n0\\napproximation is developed in appendix A under the following assumptions: (1)\\nall fields are square and equal in size to the sampling unit size, x 0, (2) the\\ncontents of any four adjacent fields are uncorrelated with respect to the crop\\nof interest, and (3) the sampling unit is randomly placed with the exception\\nthat its sides are parallel to the field boundaries. The resulting estimate\\nis given by\\n0\\nwhere p is the stratum crop proportion.\\nThird, when the sampling unit size x 0 is small relative to the size of the\\nfields, then it is possible to derive t\\'he variance in a somewhat exact form as\\ndescribed in appendix B. In this case, the estimate corresponding to the\\nY\\ndN\\nN\\nNG7\\ni\\nr-O\\'C7\\nE\\nO\\n•r\\nW\\nO\\nL\\nO\\nC\\nt0\\nS-\\n41\\nV)\\nO\\nr\\n•r\\nr\\nQ.E\\ncra\\nM\\n^:01 NLLn\\ntm\\nLL.\\nv\\n:J\\nNrN\\nr\\n•rLL\\n1\\nsmall sampling unit x O, referred to as a pixel, is approximated by the\\nequation\\naX0 = a1(1 - P) + a 2p2 _ a 3 (0.3682 - p } P) \\t (12)\\nwhere a1,a2, and a3 are defined and evaluated in terms of the crop proportion\\nand the field size distribution.\\njj\\n1\\nAs outlined earlier, equation (9) combined with any one of the equations (10),\\n(11), or (12) provide stratum-variance estimates over widely separated sampl-\\ning unit sizes from which the parameters a and S can be determined using a\\nleast-squares fit. An estimate of the stratum variance corresponding to a\\nspecified sample unit size, x, is then obtained by evaluating along the fitted\\ncurve\\nax\\tAXB\\t (13)\\nwhere A and B are tie least-squares estimates of the parameters a and a.\\nIt will be seen from the numerical results that use of both equations (11) and\\n(12) lead to fairly reliable segment level variance estimates. Yet,\\nequation (11) is probably preferable if accurate determination of the field\\nsizes can be made or if the field sizes are large. Otherwise, it is probably\\nbetter to use equation (12) since it should be less sensitive to error in the\\nfield size measurements.\\nOther estimates of the within-stratum va)^^,iances can be developed by, first,\\nusing one of the above methods to estimate crr followed by the application of\\nequation (2) to estimate Cr. However, this type of substitution will likely\\nr\\t\\n\\t result in less reliable estimates unless the proposed method estimates ar\\nsignificantly better than aP.\\n,\\n3-6\\nf\\n4. VARIANCE ESTIMATION FOR WHEAT IN THE USGP\\nI\\t14.1 WITHIN-STRATUM VARIANCE ESTIMATION METHODS\\nDescribed in this section and evaluated in section 4.3 are the within-stratum\\nvariance estimation methods derived from the methodology discussed in sec-\\ntion 3. Different methods are created not only by combining the county size\\nunits with the field or sma?ler size units but also by combining the type of\\nleast-squares fit used with either a direct estimation of aP or an indirect\\nestimation of aP by way of a  . The three combinations of the sampling unit\\nsizes for the stratum variance estimation are considered in the evaluation:\\nfield, equations (9) and (10) field, equations (9) and (11); pixel, equa -\\ntions (9) and (12). The least-squares fit is approached in three different\\nways: (1) transform the data into logarithmic scale and then minimize the sum\\nof squared deviations; (2) minimize the absolute difference between the aggre -\\ngated variance resulting from the use of the model equation and the aggregated\\nsquared deviations obtained using equation (9); and (3) minimize the sum of\\nsquared deviations of variances given by the model from tho^.e resulting from\\nthe use of equation (9). In each case, the curve aX =\\tAx8 is passed through\\nthe point (x O, ax ). The different criteria are listed in table 4-1 where, of\\n0\\t1?\\ncourse, A is replaced by a x- /x0 and the summation Z is understood to be taken\\n0\\t i\\nover all the counties in a stratum.\\nThere are 2 x 3 x 3 = 18 combinations between the type of variance a P or ar,\\nthe type of small sampling unit [equations (10), (11), or (12)], and the type\\nof estimation criterion that can be tried for empirical model development. As\\nthe computations were made and as the results were evaluated, it was dis -\\ncovered that the introduction of variable r led to less accurate variance\\nestimates than when only the variable p-was used. In addition, criterion C-3\\nin table 4-1 appeared to yield more accurate estimates than the other two cri-\\nteria. Consequently, no further combinations involving the variances a 2 or\\nthe criterion C-1 or C-2 were given consideration. This action resulted in\\n1\\nTABLE 4-1.— MODEL PARAMETER ESTIMATION CRITERIA\\nCriterion \\t Approach\\nC-1\\tMinE (log ;S2\\tlog A - B log xi )2\\ni\\nn\\nC-2\\t_\\t 2Min l E (A0i \\tn - 1 .

Each of these combina-\\ntions is designated as a variance estimation method and is listed in\\ntable 4-2.\\n4.2 DATA INPUT\\nThe wheat acreages given in the 1974 Agricultural Census Reportt^ were used in\\ncomputing the crop proportion data and in computing the ratios of crop acreage\\nto agricultural acreages for both counties and refined strata. The agricul-\\ntural acreages ut=ilized in the computations came from a complete enumeration\\nof the 5 by 6-nautical-mile segments in the USGP. In this enumeration,\\nLandsat full-frame imagery wa n, used to classify each segment as either 0- to\\n5-, 5- to 10-,---, or 95- to 100 -percent agricultural land. The segments\\nwith 5-percent or more agricultural land were designated as agricultural\\nsegments and were used in the computation of county and stratum sizes, The\\nnumber of agricultural segments in a region is called its pseudo count (PC)\\nand was taken from the L4CIE sampling frame.\\nThe average field size (more precisely the distribution of field size) varies\\nfrom strata to strata and was difficult to determine. The following techn-\\nique, employing 1974 Agriculture Census Reports data, was used to estimate the\\naverage field size \\'for a given stratum. Suppose Ni and Ai, respectively, are\\nthe number of operators and the 1974 crop acreage for the i th crop in a stra-\\ntum.

Listed in table 4-4 are\\nthese two sets of TY stratum variance estimates. Only refined strata with two\\nor more available CAMS segment proportion estimates are listed. Not listed\\nare eight strata, three of which had one segment.\\nSuppose Sik is the estimated standard deviation for the j th stratum using the\\nkth method, and a j is the TY standard deviation estimate for the j th stratum.\\nConsider the two cases for a j (either CAMS or blind sites) and compute the set\\nof differences, ((Sjk - a j)}, for each method and both cases. The mean and\\nvariance of each set of differences are then easily computed. Assuming the\\ndifference to be an estimate of the error in estimating the within-stratum\\nvariance by a method, then they (i.e., mean and variance for the difference)\\nprovide an estimate of the possible bias and the variance expected in estiriat-\\ning a stratum variance using this method. Listed. in table 4-5 are the esti-\\nmated bias and variance for each method as measured against both CAMS and\\nblind site standard deviations. In both cases, bias estimates are consist-\\nently positive for all methods.

Although criteria C-2\\n`\\t\\n\\t and C-3 competed well in this respect (e.g., the mean square error for method\\n5 versus that for method 6), it is preferable to choose criterion C-3 rather\\nthan C-2 because C-3 gives consideration to the variation in county sizes\\n4-6\\nI\\t^^\\nTABLE 4-4.- REFINED STRATUM VARIANCE ESTIMATES USING TY DATA5\\nICAMS segment estimatesGround-truth proportions\\nfor blind sites\\nAverage Average\\nStateRefined Number of wheat Standard Number of wheat Standard\\ncedestratum segments proportion deviation blind sites proportion deviation\\n8 9 3 0.143 0.090 1\\n10 21 .140 .138 6 0.095 0.064\\n20 710 .351 .131 4 .333 .074\\n8 7 .302 .044 3 .339 .080\\n910 .294 .105 3 .355 .040\\n11 23 .213 .075 7 .232 .078\\n12 21 .255 .105 6 .297 .157\\n13 7 .035 .034 2 .028 .001\\n14 11 .040 .054 3 .051 .055\\n15 3 .284 .121 2 .338 .127\\n60 2 .300 .113 0\\n102 7 .026 .038 3 .026 .014\\n27 15 7 .031 .019 1\\n19 8 .120 .052 3 .097 .064\\n20 7 .211 .082 2 .159 .060\\n30 21 6 .273 .110 2 .259 .108\\n22 7 .129 .104 4 .105 .059\\n23 6 .245 .078 2 .159 .086\\n104 14 .056 .071 2 .063 .024\\n31 10 4 .305 .194 2 .195 .272\\n11 5 .084 .083 3 .091 .040\\n14 2 .085 .007 0\\n15 15 .063 .079 4 .051 .073\\n16 2 .000 .000 0\\n103 2 .020 .028 1\\n38 18 30 .226 .102 9 .257 .089\\n20 12 .288 .079 3 .308 .046\\n21 34 .156 .098 11 .185 .111\\n40 3 9 .037 .040 3 .052 .073\\n725 .365 .160 7 .339 .167\\n9 4 .304 .173 1\\n60 7 .167 .095 3 .184 .033\\n102 10 .018 .019 3 .022 .022\\n46 15 3 .021 .012 1\\n16 9 .067 .048 2 .014 .004\\n17 4 .049 .086 2 .082 .094\\n18 3 .004 .004 1\\n19 5 .070 .069 0\\n21 4 .082 .061 1\\n48 2 9 .076 .070 3 .023 .014\\n3 8 .043 .042 3 .032 .055\\n4 8 .034 .041 3 .051 .044\\n5 7 .061 .073 1\\n61 3 .017 .029 1\\n102 5 .038 .050 1\\nTABLE 4-5.- THE ESTIMATED BIAS AND VARIANCES IN ESTIMATING\\nSTRATA VARIANCES\\nMethodBlind site\\nground truthCAMS segment\\nestimates\\nBias Variance Bias Variance\\nestimate estimate estimate estimate\\n10.0379 0.00337 0.0274 0.00148\\n2.0585 .00397 .0477 .00204\\n3.0307 .00278 .0195 .00140\\n4 .0432 ,00256 .0359 .00253\\n5.0348 .00295 .0215 .00162\\n6.0494 .00219 .0350 .00150\\n7.0134 N* .00200 .0013 N* .00123\\n8 .0239 .00200 .0110 .00109\\nSymbol definition:\\nCAMS = Classification and Mensuration Subsystem\\nN*\\t= Insignificant bias when the 5-percent\\nsignificance t-test is used\\nthat is ignored in C-2.

For variance estimates, this was per-\\nhaps due to a much smaller number of blind sites than the number of acquired\\nsegments for which CAMS estimates were available. However, higher numbers for\\nthe bias estimates reflect that stratum variance estimates were on the average\\ncloser to those obtained from the CAMS segment estimates than to those using\\nground-truth proportions. This implies that the proposed approach is more\\nlikely to estimate the total error (i.e., sampling and classification com-\\nbined) variance than the sampling error variance. Though desirable, this\\nresult is somewhat intriguing since no consideration was given to the clas-\\nsification variance while developing this methodology.\\nThe stratum variance estimates produced by this methodology are further influ-\\nenced by the sampling unit size, x 0, (either field or pixel) used in develop-\\ning.the modeled variance dX . The situation is graphically illustrated in \\t l\\n0figure 3-1 in section 3. A comparison of the numerical results for methods 6,\\n7, and 8 shows that the most accurate variance estimates are obtained using\\nthe pixel variance model [i.e., equation (12) for a  ]. This result was some-\\n0\\nwhat surprising since better variance estimates were expected from the use of\\nfield variance model [i.e., equation (11) for a ] and it may have been due to\\n0\\nthe sensitivity of method 8 to the poor field size estimates used in the eval-\\nuation. The field size estimates computed from the ratio of crop acreages to\\nfarm operators were on the average four times larger than field size estimates\\ncomputed from a limited set of ground truth given by Pitts and Badhwar\\n(ref..10). Note that a farm operator (accounted for by crop type) may have\\nmore than one field of a given crop type, hence, the average field size can be\\nexpected to be smaller than the value estimated using equation (14). The\\nnumerical results tend to confirm thili. _Regardless of the method used, the\\nstratum field sizes must be determined and the best possible information\\nshouldshould be used for the evaluation. If data on crop statistics and cropping\\n4-9     E \\'.\\n1\\tr\\npractices from which the field size, f 0, can be estimated is unavailable, then\\nLandsat imagery can be employed to obtain an estimate of average field size\\nfor a stratum.\\'\\nTo examine the effect of field size on the stratum variance estimates, similar\\ncomputations were made using method 6 corresponding to reduced field sizes of\\n0.5f0, 0.25f0, 0.1f0, 0.05f0, and the average field size from Pitts-Badhwar\\ndata. The estimated bias and variance resulting from these calculations are\\nF\\t\\n\\t listed in table 4-6. From the table, it is noted that bias estimates\\ndecreased by two and one-half times as the field was reduced to 5 percent of\\nits original size. Yet, variance estimates show no major change. The case of\\n3\\t\\n\\t Pitts-Badhwar corresponds to using a constant value of 0.2Jf 0 for the field\\nsize in all strata. The reduction in bias associated with field size reduc-\\ntion can be taken as numerical confirmation of the fact that the actual size\\nof sample units having crop proportions either 0 or 1 is substantially smaller\\nthan the stratum field size, f0.\\nFrom the derivation of equation (12) given in appendix B, it is observed that\\nan adjustment is made to the variance a 2 for the proportions of small squares\\n0\\n(pixels) in the strata that are mixed. And, the proportion of mixed squares\\nis a function not only of the stratum crop proportion„5ut also of the stratum\\nfield size.- Yet, when a field size of 0.25f 0 was substituted for f 0 in\\nmethod 7, no change in the variance from the value reported in table 4-5 was\\nobserved although a slight reduction in the bias was observed, 0.0009 versus\\n0.00013. Similarly, the relati,^Pnship of equation (10) to equation -(11) is\\nthat of making an adjustment to the variance a 2 for a sampling unit equal to\\n=-\\t 0\\nthe size of an average field to account for the fact that such a sampling unit\\nis expected to contain both crop and noncrop acreage. Since the adjustment\\nfactor from equation (`10) to equation (11) is a constant multiplier of 4/9,\\nthe primary improvement of equation (11) over equation (10) is to reduce the\\nbias. \\'Note in table 4-5 that the bias is considerably less for method 8 in\\nboth cases although the reduction; in variance is only from 0.00150 to 0.00109\\nin the case of the CAMS comparison and from 0.00219 to 0.00200 in the case of\\nthe ground-truth comparison.\\n4-10\\nti\\naComputed in the case of TY CAMS segment\\nestimates.field size)Field sizeBias\\nestimateVariance\\nestimate\\nX0 0.0350 0.00150\\n0.5x0 .0334 .00192\\n0.25x0 .0231 .00137\\n0.10x0 .0176 .00133\\n0.05x0 .0143 .00131\\nPitts- .0231 .00142\\nBadhwar\\n(AverageTABLE 4-6.- ESTIMATED a BIAS AND VARIANCE FOR REDUCED\\nFIELD SIZE FOR METHOD 6\\nF\\nListed in table 4-7 are individual stratum standard deviation estimates\\nobtained for methods 7 and 8.

This\\nresult is expected of the methodology, as discussed previously. In addition,\\nan examination of A and B values across the strata suggests that A is signifi-\\ncantly influenced by the stratum crop proportion and B is highly dependent\\nupon the between-county variance. (See table 4-3 for information on the stra-\\ntum crop proportion and the between-county variance.)

CONCLUSION AND SUMMARY\\nThe present study considers several stratum-variance estimation techniques and\\nproposes a new method to obtain initial variance estimates for sample alloca-\\ntions in designing crop surveys. The approach is to develop empirically a\\nrelationship between the stratum variance and the sampling unit size.\\nA procedure is devised that uses existing and easily available information of\\nhistorical crop statistics in developing this relationship. Consideration is\\ngiven to the field size in order to effect a modification in stratum variance\\nthat is necessary for small sampling unit sizes.\\nVariance estimation is approached in two ways: (1) estimate the stratum vari-\\nance for crop proportion directly by developing the empirical model, and (2)\\nfirst, estimate the stratum variance for the crop to agricultural acreage\\nratio by developing the empirical model, and then combine this variance\\nestimate with the stratum mean and variance for the agricultural acreage.\\nThe numerical results indicated that the first approach should be preferred\\nbecause it led to more accurate estimates (when compared with variance esti-\\nmates obtained from segment data for wheat in USGP) than did the second\\napproach.\\nI\\nIn addition, the numerical results tend to show that methods 7 ari 8 perform\\nabout equally well and that either method produces realistic stratum variance\\nestimates, given reliable input data. However, method 8 is probably more sen-\\nsitive to the field size variable and should be used if accurate field size\\ndeterminations can be made.

Crop X will refer to the crop of interest. The\\nmodel is developed using the definitions and assumptions in the following\\nconceptual experiment.\\nA square area unit with diagonal 2d is randomly selected from the area of a\\nstratum having a proportion \"p for crop X. A random variable P is defined\\nover the sample space of the experiment as follows. P has value p if the\\nrandomly selected square has proportion p for crop X. Probabilities a l, a2,\\nand a3 are associated, respectively, with the following events: the square\\nselected is pure and contains only crop X; the square selected is pure and\\ndoes not contain crop X; and the square selected is mixed. With this nota-\\ntion, it is observed that\\nal = P rob (P = 1)\\na2 = Prob(P = 0)\\na3\\tProb(0 < P < 1)\\n091 + a 2 + a3 = 1\\nE(P) = P\\nVar(P) = a 1(l - a)2 + a20  + a3EP40<P<1(P - p)2\\nwhere the expectation in the last equation is understood to be taken over the\\ncollection corresponding to the mixed squares. Tractable analytic expressions\\nfor the probabilities a l, a2, and a3 and the expected value E p^O<P<1(P - p)2\\nin terms of the stratum-field-size distribution and the crop proportion, p, for\\ncrop X will be derived first.\\nAssume that the stratum has area A and the crop X fields of length l i and wi\\nhave relative frequencies f it i = 1, 2, ---, N. A typical field of crop X is\\ndisplayer\\' in figure B-1, where b is the expected \"width\" of a square falling\\non the field boundary (mixed square). It will be shown later that the average\\nvalue of 2d cos a over 0 < e <- 7r/4 gives a reasonable value for b. Since the\\nmodel derived is for sampling units that are small relative to crop X field\\nsizes, assume that b << l i and b << w i for all i and the distance between\\nany two fields of crop X is greater than or equal to b.\\nTo determine the probabilities a l, a2, and a3, first note that the pure crop\\narea and the mixed area associated with a field of length l i and width w i are\\ngiven, respectively, by\\n` 1 - b) (wi - b)\\nand\\n(li + b)(w i + b) - (li - b)(wi - b)\\t (B-1)\\nr\\nNext note that the total number of fields of length l i and wi is given by\\nA\\t(B-2)\\nfi liwi\\nFrom these equations and the definition of a l,a2\\', and a3, it follows that\\n1N IiOA\\n(XlA 1_1 liwi (1.i - b)(wi -b)\\t\\nN\\t0 i - b)(wi - b)\\t\\n= P\\tf^\\tliwi\\t\\n- 1\\t JfiPA\\n0\\'3\\tA\\t1 w.

To be most suited for this purpose, a sensor must be non-\\ncontacting, have a measurement range of 6-in. or more, and an accuracy of\\n1/2-in. or better. In addition, the sensor should be insensitive to varia-\\ntions in spacing between the sensor and the surface, the response speed\\nshould be adequate to permit use on continuous mining equipment, and the\\ndevice should be rugged and otherwise suited for operation under conditions\\nof high vibration, moisture, and dust. Finally, the sensor measurement must\\nnot be adversely affected by the natural effects occurring in coal such as\\nimpurities, voids, cracks, layering, high moisture level, and other conditions\\nthat are likely to be encountered.\\nThe work reported herein has been concerned with the continued deve-\\nlopment of the technique of electron magnetic resonance (EMR) for use as the\\nbasis for the coal thickness gauge. This technique offers many potential\\nadvantages over other methods that have been previously con:.!dered and, if\\nproperly implemented, provides a very practical solution to this measurement\\nproblem. The basic feasibility of the EMR method was previously established\\nand the results described in Part I of the Final Report of Contract NAS8-32606.\\nThe goal of the work under Part II and Part III of the contract has been the\\ndevelopment of an experimental model to further demonstrate the utility of the\\nEMR technique for coal thickness gauging.\\nB.Background\\nThe investigation conducted under the initial phases of Contract No.\\nNAS8-32606 and reported in Part I of the Final Report included extensive labora-\\ntory measurements of the EMR response characteristics of coal and rock samples\\ntaken from locations near and across a variety of interface regions. An\\nevaluation of the technique based on an analytical model of a thickness gauging\\nconcept was also carried out. The concept was experimentally studied using\\nlaboratory apparatus to verify analytical results. All the results obtained\\nin this work confirmed the basic feasibility of using EMR as the basis for the\\ndevelopment of a practical coal thickness gauge. A limited investigation of\\nthe nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characteristics of coal and rock samples\\nwas alto conducted and, while additional useful information on coal character-\\nistics was obtained, this method was not found to be as promising for thick-\\nness gauging as EMR.\\nThe laboratory investigation of coal and rock samples indicated that\\nthe coal-rock interface as well as the coal-air interface are both readily\\ndiscernible on the basis of the large difference in amplitude of the EMR res-\\nponse obtained frcm coal compared to that from either air or rock. Positive\\nresults in these characteristics confirmed the existence of a measurable EMR\\neffect that could be useful in defining the location of the front and back\\nsurfaces and thus the thickness of coal overlying a rock substrate.\\n2\\nTo further es_ablish the suitability of the EMR technique for coal\\nthickness gauging, an analytical study was conducted. This analysis was\\nbased on the findings of the foregoing sample studies and a conceptual model\\nof a low-frequency EMR system which was considered to be basically suitable\\nfor use in the coal gauging application. This study provided information\\non (1) the effects of selecteo system design parameters on the detection\\nrange and other characteristics, ;2) the attainable resolution in defining\\nthe location of the front surface (coal-air interface) as well as the back\\n(coal-rock) interface, and (3) the detection sensitivity. The results of\\nthis analysis indicate the excellent probability of achieving coal thickness\\nmeasurement resolution on the order of 1.0-cm or less, a thickness gauging\\nrange of 15-cm or . pore, and noncontacting operation. The study also indicated\\nthat the detection head required for such results could be of acceptable size,\\nweight, and power requirements and basically suitable for use in the mining\\nenvironment.\\nThe basic suitability of the EMR technique to coal thickness measure-\\nment was verified by assembly and use of an experimental laboratory apparatus\\nto confirm the important characteristics of the analytical models. This\\napparatus demonstrated the feasibility of detecting the EMR response in coal\\nsamples at the low magnetic field intensity (and corresponding low resonant\\nfrequency ranges) assumed in the analytical model. Tests were conducted with\\nthe apparatus to determine the available sensitivity and the linewidth of\\nthe EMR resonance at magnetic field intensities of 57 and 142 Gauss, corres-\\nponding to those used in the analytical model, and in coal samples located a\\nshort distance outside the physical extent o.\\'. the detection coil.\\nWhile the results obtained in the initial work demonstrated the basic\\nfeasibility of the EMR method, further work was needed to develop a model of\\nthe EMR coal thickness gauge which would be suitable for evaluation of the\\nmeasurement range, gauging accuracy, speed, and other characteristics. The\\nlaboratory model used to evaluate the concept in the initial work made use of\\na continuous wave balanced bridge type detection configuration which, if\\ncarefully adjusted, yielded very sensitive results. However, the problems of\\nmaintaining such balance in the mining environment were felt to be sufficiently\\nsevere as to preclude the development of an instrumentation system based on\\nthis approach. Other means of implementing the EMR detection function were\\nconsidered necessary in order to obtain sufficient stability to allow the\\nmethod to be applied to the coal gauging application. Further work in the\\nanalytical study was also needed to determine optimum system design parameters\\nand to evaluate the influence of operational conditions on the speed, range\\nand accuracy of the thickness measurements. Based on these findings, an\\nexperimental model of the coal thickness gauge needed to be developed for\\nfurther evaluation of the EMR technique under laboratory conditions and then\\nin a mine where tests may be conducted under controlled conditions. This\\nadditional work has been the goal of the program effort under Part II and\\nPart III of the Contract. During Part II, the use of transient EMR detec-\\ntion methods were explored while the work under Part III was directed toward\\ninvestigation of a dual frequency technique for sensitive detection of the\\nEMR response from coal.\\n3\\nC. Results of Part II\\nTo overcome the problems of instrumentation stability inherent in\\ncontinuous wave balanced bridge detectors, alternate approaches to imple-\\nmenting the EMR detection function were considered. On the basis of prior\\nexperience at Southwest Research Institute in the use of transient methods\\nfor nuclear magnetic resonance (MR) detection, this technique appeared to\\noffer promise for achieving the desired iap rovements in the most simple,\\nreadily achievable manner. Since prior use of transient EMR (for special\\nmaterials having favorable characteristics) had been reported in the litera-\\nture, it was known that this method could be used for electron magnetic\\nresonance detection. Use of the transient method was therefore recommended\\nand demonstration of the transient method of EMR detectior was specified as\\na contract requirement. The initial work of the Part II contract effort was\\ndirected toward meeting this goal.\\nIn the transient method a short burst of radiofrequency energy at the\\nresonant frequency is impressed upor the sample located in a magnetic field.\\nFollowing the end of the burst, the decaying response (free induction decay\\nor FID) induced in the resonant electrons or nuclei may be detected. The\\ndecay time for nuclear magnetic resonance typically ranges from a few micro-\\nseconds to tens of milliseconds. Similarly, the sample materials used for\\nthe transient EMR tests previously reported had decay time constants on the\\norder of microseconds. However, for the electrons in coal, the decay is much\\nmore rapid being on the order of 30 to 40 nanoseconds and the detection pro-\\ncess from the beginning of the transmitted burst of energy to the sensing\\nof the EMR response must be completed in a comparably short time period if\\noptimum sensitivity is to be obtained. Thus, to detect a response from\\ncoal, the transmitter output burst was required to be only a few nanoseconds\\nlong and the detection recovery time following the transmitter burst was\\nsimilarly limited to such short time periods. mtaining such operating con-\\nditions while maintaining sufficient sensitivity to achieve the detection\\nrange that is necessary for coal thickness gauging applications proved to be\\na very difficult problem to overcome.\\nThe majority of the Part II effort was devoted to finding practical\\nsolutions to the above problems. Successful detection of the transient EMR sig-\\nnals from coal at a center frequency of a pproximately 400 MHz was achieved and\\ndemonstrated. However, due primarily to recovery time problems. the useful\\nsensitivity was not considered to be adequate for the application of this\\nmethod to coal thickness gauging. The possibility of using more intense mag-\\nnetic fields to allow the operating frequency to be raised to 1 GHz or greater\\nwas considered as a means for overcoming the sensitivity limitation as well\\nas a means for enhancing the possibility of achieving a faster recovery time.\\nThis was not attractive for the intended application, however, because of the\\nincreased size, weight, and power requirements for the production of such\\nintense magnetic fields over large volumes external to the magnet structure.\\nIn view of thi:., an alternate approach to the des.:gn of the experimental\\napparatus was considered.\\nThe alternate approach to EMR detection makes use of a dual-frequency\\nconcept which offers the advantage of -`ability and freedom from the effects\\nof the environment which are characteristic of the transient method. It does,\\n4\\nhowever, provide these advantages without the requirements for rapid recovery\\ntime and other limiting factors encountered in the transient method. This\\ndual-frequency method, shown in Figure 1, was demonstrated in the laboratory\\nalong with its capability to detect coal samples at distances up to 15 cm\\n(E-in.) from the sensing coil. The basic concept for using this method of\\nEMR detection for coal thickness gauging was also developed but, due to\\nthe previously described and unanticipated technical difficulties, demon-\\nstration was not possible within the available contract funds for Part II.\\nDevelopment of a model of the coal thickness gauge based on this concept now\\nneeds to be carried out to allow experimental evaluation of this concept in\\nthe laboratory and then in a mine suitable for controlled tests. Results of\\nthe preliminary investigation appear to warrant the further development of\\nthe EMR technique for this purpose.\\nD. Results of Part III\\nUnder Part III of the contract, an experimental model of the E24R\\ncoal thickness gauge based on the dual frequency detection concept was devel-\\noped and evaluated in the laboratory. The basic design of the model was simi-\\nlar to that shown in Figure 1, but differed in a few details to make it suit-\\nable for detection of the EMR response from materials outside the physical\\nextent of the apparatus as is required for in situ coal measurements and to\\nprovide the depth resolution required for thickness gauging. Both of these\\nfeatures are basically realized by use of a U-shaped electromagnet instead\\nof the parallel plate type shown in Figure 1. The poles of this magnet were\\nspaced approximately 12\" center-to-oenter and were 10\" wide. By control of\\nthe current to this electromagnet, a field of the intensity required for\\nelectron magnetic resonance at distances ranging from zero up to 8-inches\\nfrom the pole faces could be produced. As is described in Section II.A, the\\ngradient in the intensity of the field of the magnet provided the spatial\\nresolution required to establish the distance at which EMR detection occurred.\\nThe coils for the lower radiofrequency (5 MHz) were also made concentric\\nwith poles of the magnet. Other changes included provisions for using the\\nsame UHF detection -oil (or antenna) for both tzansmitting and receiving, a\\nslight increase in both the radiofrequencies, and the use of a sweeper to\\ncyclically vary the distance range at which ESR detection occurred. The\\nexperimental apparatus is pictured and described more fully in Appendix C.\\nTests with the system showed the capability to detect the EMR res-\\nponse from a block of coal at distances up to 2-inches above the uppermost\\npart of the U-shaped magnet and antenna assembly and to resolve both the\\nupper and the lower coal-air interfaces to within 0.04 inches (1.0 mm).\\nThus, except for the range, the technique was shown to be suitable for non-\\ncontact coal thickness gauging.\\nIn efforts to resolve the reasons for the detection range being\\nless than the desired 8-inches, further tests were conducted with the block\\nof coal, modulation coils and sensing antenna located in a homogeneous mag-\\nnetic field. The apparatus was otherwise the same. Under these conditions,\\nthe block of coal (approximately 3\" thick x 10\" square) could be detected at\\na range of 8-inches from the antenna with a usable (2:1) signal-to-noise\\n\\'\\t Sample\\nf\\n^\\t I\\niGHF Coils\\nUHF Coil —\\nUIIF\\nTransmitter\\n(400 MHz)\\n.n\\nTransmitter\\nv\\'\\t IS MHz)\\nElectromagnet —i\\nI\\nI\\t^\\nI\\t^\\nI\\nReceive Coil\\nIi ^I\\n400 MHz\\nReject\\nFilter\\nSelective\\nReceiver\\n(405 MHz)S\\nMagnet\\nPower Supply\\n18 HzLock in\\nAmplifier\\n(18 Hz)\\n18 HzI\\nOutput\\nLF\\nField Modulator\\nFIGURE 1.

This suggests that the primary reason for the inadequate detection\\nrange with the U-shaped magnet is the excessive gradient in the field which\\ncauses the effective volume of the coal within the appropriate field inten-\\nsity band to be very small and the resultant E14R signal to be relatively\\nweak. To overcome this problem and to otherwise ,,ptimi:e the detection\\nsensitivity of the apparatus, the following steps are recommended:\\n1.Alter the magnet design to provide a lower field\\ngradient at the measurement range. This will in-\\nincrease the effective volume of the coal which is\\nsensed and thereby improve the signal-to-noise\\nratio. Even with this change, the thJ e-kness mea-\\nsurement resolution can still be made to be 0.5\\ninches or better.\\n2.Increase the magnetic field intensity and the asso-\\nciated EMR fr • .uency to approximately twice that\\nnow being usei This will provide an S/N improve-\\nment of 4:1 and increase the measurement range by\\nan estimated factor of 2:1.\\n3.Increase the modulation frequency to be more optimum\\nfor coal and proportionately increase the available\\nmodulation power.\\n4.Incorporate more advanced signal processing methods\\nto better extract the desired signal from the noise.\\nWith these changes, the detection range will be substantially in-\\ncreased and the probability of achieving the desired range of 8-inches is\\nbelieved to be very high. This should allow the technique to be success-\\nfully used for in situ coal thickness gauging in mining applications.\\n7\\nII. SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT\\nA. Basic Concept\\nTo make use of the EMR technique, the material under test must be\\nboth exposed to a ma gnetic field, Ho, and excited by an appropriate radio-\\nfrequency field, Hl. The detected response is also in the form of a\\nradiotrequency signal having an amplitude proportional to the number of\\nfree electrons in the sample, a frequency proportional to the magnetic field\\nintensity, and a form which is dependent upon the characteristics of the\\nmaterial and the detector throughput. The basic concept, illustrated in\\nFigure 2, shows a sensor which uses a two-pole U-shaped magnet with a radio-\\nfrequency detection coil located between and in the plane of the two magnetic\\npoles. The magnet structure produces the required magnetic bias field, Ho.\\nThe coil is connected to an appropriate transmitter, receiver and auxiliary\\napparatus to produce th- required radiofrequency f.eld and to detect the\\nEMR response fron material exposed to the field of the coil. The magnetic\\nbias fields extend outward from the pole of the magnet and can interact with\\nany unpaired electrons in the material located within the field to produce\\nan EMR signal at frequency, fo. The EMR frequency fo is related to the mag-\\nnetic field by\\nfo - yHo/2n \\t (1)\\nwhere y = gyranagnetic ratio of electrons = 17.61 x 10 6 foi free electrons.\\nHo - particular value of magnetic field intensity viquired for resonance\\nexpressed in Gauss. For free electrons\\nfo - 2.8 x 10 6 Ho\\t (2)\\nFor example, if Ho is 100 Gauss the EMR frequency is 280 MHz.\\nFor the \\' 1-shaped magnet of Figure 2, the field intensity Ho varies\\nas functions of distance and direction from the plane of the poles. Thus,\\nthe EMR frequency for free electrons would vary as a function of location\\nwithin the material, and, by adjusting the pole strength, the EMR frequency\\nanywhere in the material can be made to be equal to any desired value fo.\\nOnly those electrons located where the value of Ho is proper for resonance\\nat fo will be detected. By varying the pole strength over a selected range\\nas a function of time, the field strength Ho required for EMR at frequency\\nfo can be made to sweep through the material as a function of time and permit\\ndetection of EMR in any region of the sample. At any one time the exact field\\nintensity Ho required for resonance occurs along the line of constant flux\\ndensity as illustrated in Figure 2. Since the EMR energy absorption curve\\nhas a finite width (linewidth), some response will be produced by electrons\\nin the band of material extending on each side of the exact Ho line. Thus,\\nthe EMR thickness gauge concept is based on the use of a bias magnet which\\nmay be varied in intensity to cause EMR for a particular operating frequency\\nfo to sequentially occur over known distance ranges between the sensor unit\\nand the depth within the coal layer.\\n11\\' I\\nillI I\\ta\\n111 ^I\\n4Jw\\nO - A\\nO ^C O.r O\\nauwW\\nl7s\\nQ\\nNN\\nW\\n2\\nYUHTH\\nJ\\nQ\\nOu\\naU)UZ0U\\nNQ[I1\\nN\\nW\\nU\\'\\nH11It\\nLn\\ncn\\nLna^\\nw\\naO a\\nH Q8\\n9\\nThe radiofrequency coil and associated electronic circuitry detect an\\nEMR response from the volume of material where the field intensity iR within\\nthe EMR linewidth (about 5 to 8 Gauss in coal) of the resonance intensity Ho.\\nCoal has been found to produce an EMR response of relatively large amplitude\\nwhile rock exhibits only a very weak EMR characteristic and air produces no\\nresponse. Thus, if the magnetic field intensity is such that Ho occurs\\nwithin a region filled with crial then a relative ly large EMR response will\\nbe obtained. Conversely, if the field is of such value that H o occurs either\\nin the rock ^r in the air then a small EMR res ponse is obtained. If the mag-\\nnetic field intensity is made to vary such as to cause the resonance value,\\nHo, to be swept over the air-coal interface and across the coal-rock interface\\nthere will be an abrupt change in the amplitude of the detected EMR responses\\nat both of these points. This can be used tc define the location of both the\\nfront surface of the coal and the coal-rock interface. Knowlelge of the loca-\\ntion of these points relative to the sensor allows the coal thickness to be\\nmeasured.\\nFigure 3 shows a block diagram of the basic EMR system for thickness\\ngauging. The transmitter provides the radiofrequency power to the sample coil\\nto generate an electromagnetic field Hl. The receiver detects the EMR response\\nproduced by the free electrons in the coal and the display system provides an\\noutput in a form suitable for the intended Application. The sequencer provides\\nsynchronization for the radiofrequency signal generated by the transmitter,\\nthe sweeping of the magnetic field, and the processing of the detected EMR\\nsignals. Several means of implementing the EMR detection function for this\\nbasic concept are available. Those that have been considered for use in the\\ncoal thickness gauge have included the balanced bridge continuous wave method,\\nthe transient method using both the free induction decay and the pulse-echo,\\nand a dual-f quency method in which a resonant mixing occurs due in the free\\nelectrons as d result of the EMR characteristics. The continuous wave method\\nwas previously described and considered in the work described in Part I of the\\nFinal Report. Both the transient method and the dual-frequency method were\\nconsidered and experimentally evaluated during the worti. on this portion of\\nthe program.\\nB. Transient System\\n1. General\\nThe transient means of implementing the EMR detection offers the\\npromise of providing high sensitivity and a means for overcoming the stability\\nand proximity problem which are characteristics of the more commonly used\\nbalanced bridge (or equivalent) type steady-state designs. Such characteristics\\nare required if the EMR technique is to be practical for use in a mining\\nenvironment. While there are other possibilities for achieving the required\\nsystem performance, the transient aethod appeared in the initial assessment to\\nbe advantageous and the preferred method based on simplicity and the expected\\nperformance. However, even though the transient approach had been widely used\\nfor nuclear magnetic resonance detection, it had ,nly been applied to EMR in\\na v-ry few cases. The lack of general use for EMR is not too surprising since\\nthf, .esign requirements for such generally useful transient EMR call for the\\nuse of RF pulses of only a few nanoseconds duration and an appropriately wide\\nLn\\nLn\\nM\\nLn10\\nMate vial of\\nInterest\\nL •^..SJi•^r^\"^fi.

BASIC ELECTRON MAGNETIC RESONANCE SYS TEM FOR\\nTHE COAL THICKNESS GAUGE\\n11\\nbandwidth in the coupling network, sample coil and receiver. Technology and\\ndevices to permit practical operation in the nanosecond regime have only\\nrecently been readily available. These were used in the initial contract\\neffort to develop the transient method for EMR detection.\\nSeveral transient techniques are used in magnetic resonance\\nwc=k. The simpliest of these makes use of the free induction decay (FID)\\nwhich follows a single transmitted burst of energy. This decaying response\\nproduced by the unpaired electrons in EMR and by selected nuclei for NMR is\\ndetected by the receiver and used to obtain information in regard to the EMR\\ncharacteristics of the material in the sensing region of the apparatus. The\\nspin-echo mode appeared to be more advantageous for EMR and was used as the\\nba-is for the transient system developed i- this contract. With this method\\nthe sample is exposed to two short, closely spaced pulse bursts of radio-\\nfrequency energy having a frequency corresponding to magnetic resonance of\\nthe electron in the magnetic field. The EMR response obtained from the\\nmaterial is a short burst of RF which occurs at a time equal to the pulse-\\nto-pulse spacing after the end of the second excitation pulse. This frequency\\nof the response is at the resonant frequency of electrons in the magnetic\\nfield and is typically of a 20 to 30 nanoseconds in duration and occurs at\\nsimilar time after the second transmitter burst.\\nA block diagran of the basic transient EMR system is shown in\\nFigure 4. Based on several considerations and tradeoffs, a nominal operating\\nfrequency of 400 MHz was determined to be most optimum and was selected for\\nuse in the thickness gauge. These considerations included: (1) the low\\nattenuation of electromagnetic waves of that frequency in coal; (2) the re-\\nquirements for a magnet of reasonable size, weight, and power consumption;\\n(3) adequate sensitivity; and (4) the requirement to have the time period\\nfor one cycle of the wave to be very short compared to the EMR decay time\\nconstant. Use of higher frequencies would yield improved sensitivity but\\nwould require larger magnetic structures to produce the higher field inten-\\nsities. In addition, as the frequency of the waves is increased the\\nattenuation of the radiofrequency waves in the coal becomes larger. Thus,\\na frequency in the vicinity of 400 MHz appeared to be optimum for this appli-\\ncation. In the system shown in Figure 4, therefore, the radiofrequency\\ngenerator provides a pulsed output centered on a frequency of 400 MHz. The\\noutput format may be either in the form of a single pulse for FID or a double\\npulse sequence to provide a spin-echo mode of operation. The length of each\\npulse is typically in the range of 25 to 40 nanoseconds and spacing between\\npulses is in the same time range. For maximum sensitivity, the repetition\\nrate should be as lame as possible but it is limited by the recovery time\\nconstant T1 of the electrons in coal and typically may be on the order of\\n1 MHz or greater. Fcr best sensitivity, the peak power in the output pulses\\nfrom the RF generator should be made to be the specific value that causes a\\ngoo precession of the , plectron spin axis in the magnetic field. The require-\\nments for this condition are discussed later but in practice it is very\\ndifficult to achieve a sufficiently high power level along with an adequately\\nfast recovery time.\\nPulse\\nSequencer\\nMatching\\nNetworksRadiofrequency\\nPower AmplifierRadiofrequency\\nDetection\\nCoil12\\nV\\tH\\nRadiofrequency\\nGeneratorRadiofrequency\\nAmplifier and\\nDetector\\nMM\\nO\\nLn\\nFIGURE 4. BLOCK DIAGRAM OF THE TRANSIENT ELECTRON\\nMAGNETIC RESONANCE DETECTOR\\n^I\\n13\\n2.Literature Survey\\nTo aid in assessment of the probability of successfully achieving\\nEMR detection of coal with a transient system and also to aid in determining\\nthe system design parameters, a literature survey of the technical and scien-\\ntific journals was conducted. The computer-assisted literature search spanned\\nappropriate scientific and technical journals and reports from 1964 to the\\npresent. Combinations of key words including electron paramagnetic resonance\\nand its variations, transient or relaxation, and spectrometer or coal were\\nexamined and printed by the .:omputer. Three-hundred and seventy abstracts\\nfitted the key words of the search. Of these abstracts, 6 contained infor-\\nmation pertinent to the use of transient methods for meas ,iring coal. From\\nthese references a few other papers rublished prior to 1965 were located.\\nWhile the basic ideas of transient EMR have been experimentally\\nconfirmed and reported in the literature, the primary use has been limited\\nto certain cross-relaxation studies. Studies of isolated free radicals such\\nas Na+ions in ammonia solutiuns have been conducted over a wide range of\\nfrequencies from 1 .4 MHz (corresponding to 6.04 Gauss) (1) to the X- and\\nhigher microwave regions. (2-3) These radicals have relaxation times in the\\nmicrosecond range making them accessible to pulsed NMR technology at the\\nlower frequencies. The advanced work is mostly confined to the microwave\\nrange and to the electron spin to nuclear spin cross-relaxation studies.\\nHowever, basic information sought about irradiating power, recovery rates,\\nand spin densities were found. (2) A few other references contained technical\\ninformation on the detection apparatus. The relaxation rates of the naturally\\noccurring free radicals are very rapid at standard temperatures being on the\\norder of 40 nanoseconds (40 x 10 -9 sec.). This affords rapid probing rates\\nbut also makes stringent demands upon the equipment. Two further items of\\ninterest were found. First, the sensitivity in terms of spin density of the\\ntransient method has been found to be excellent (2), and secondly, the require-\\nment of the irradiating magnetic field being greater than the natural resonant\\nrange of the sample is not as rigid if longer pulse lengths are used. (2) This\\ndoes lead to some signal deterioration, however. Thus, while transient EMR\\nhad been previously reported in the literature, most of the studies have been\\nconcerned with electrons having much longer relaxation times than those typical\\nof coal. In addition, most of the work has been carried out in the microwave\\nfrequency range where the required rapid recovery of the apparatus following\\nthe transmitter burst is more readily achieved.\\n3.System Analysis\\nModeling analysis calculations were performed for a coal detecting\\nEMR system to determine the radiofrequency power required for optimum per-\\nformance, the detector bandwidth requirements and the sensitivity of the system\\nin terms of spin density, and to determine the variation in sensitivity as\\na function of sensor-to-sample distance. One of the prime requirements in the\\ndesign of a transient EMR system is the determination of the width of the\\npulse burst to be transmitted and (for Lhe spin-echo mode) the pulse-to-pulse\\nspacing. These requirements are set by the EMR response time constants in the\\nmaterial to be detected. These, in turn, are controlled by the spin-spin\\nrelaxation time T 2 which is characteristic of the material to be studied.\\n14\\nAnother system design requirement which must be considered is the repetition\\nrate to be utilized. It is desirable from considerations of minimum detection\\ntime, maximum signal-to-noise ratio for this to be as high as possible. The\\nmaximum rate that can be effectively utilized, however, is set by the spin-\\nlattice relaxation time Tl which is also characteristic of the particular\\nmaterial. In EMR, Tl is slightly larger than T2 but calculations to deter-\\nmine the system specification will be of sufficient accuracy if T 1 is assumed\\nto be equal to T2.\\nThe time constant T2 is inversely proportional to the linewidth\\n(in equivalent frequency) of the EMR response. Information from the literature\\nand that from studies conducted at SwRI shows that the linewidths for coals\\nrange from 8 Gauss for subbituminous types to as narrow as 1 Gauss for\\nanthracite. The corresponding values of T2 for these two extremes are 14 x\\n10-9 and 114 x 10 -9 seconds, respectively. The soft coal measured earlier in\\nthis program showed typical linewidth on the order of 5 to 6 Gauss which\\ncorresponds to T2 values in the range of 19 to 23 nanoseconds.\\nFor maximum EMR response, the burst of transmitter excitation\\nenergy and the spacing between bursts must be short compared to T2. In prac-\\ntice this requirement can be relaxed somewhat, but if time periods are much\\ngreater than T2, the amplitude of the EMR echo response is seriously degraded.\\nAs another consideration, for maximum EMR response, the product of the RF\\npulse width T and the intensity of the RF magnetic field Hl should be equal\\nto a value that will cause the spin axis of any free electron exposed to the\\nenergetic burst to precess through an angle 90 0 relative to the fixed magnetic\\nfield, Ho. For EMR the product TH1 for the so called \"90 0 pulse\" is 88 x 10-9.\\nThus, if the pulse width is 22 x 10 -9 seconds (22 nanoseconds) the RF magnetic\\nfield intensity must be 4 Gauss (peak) if the EMR response amplitude is to be\\nmaximized. If the product TH 1 is less than that required for a 90 0 pulse, the\\namplitude of EMR response decreases as a function of sin g where 9 is (THl/88)\\n(900). For example, if the TH 1 product is 44 then the effective precessional\\nangle produced by the pulse is 45 0 and the amplitude of the EMR response is\\n0.707 of what would be obtained if a 90 0 pulse were used. These factors were\\nconsidered in the design of the experimental system.\\nThe EMR detection circuits are gated to allow signal samples to\\nbe collected at the peak of the EMR echo response. Subsequent samples are\\nintegrated to produce the final output. Consequently, the detected signal-\\nto-noise ratio is improved as the number of samples which are collected within\\na specified operation period is increased. To maximize this feature, the\\nrepetition rate should be made as high as possible within the limitations\\nimposed by T1 of the material. Since Tl for coal will be a maximum of about\\n100 nanoseconds, the pulse (and sample) repetition rate as high as 1 MHz\\nappears useful and even higher repetition rates could prove advantageous.\\nUsing the foregoing relaxation times for coal, the system bandwidth\\nrequirements were determined to be on the order of 60 MHz. From considerations\\nof the propagation characteristics of electron magnetic waves in coal as well\\nas the limitations on the size, weight, and power requirements for the magnet,\\nan operating frequency of 400 MHz was selected. With this choice a system Q\\nof approximately 6 was determined as being optimum. This is the maximum Q\\nthat should be utilized in the sample coil circuitry. Bandwidths equivalent\\n15\\nto the calculated system bandwidths (60 MHz) are required throughout the\\nsystem where there are limitations affected by this parameter. These com-\\nponents include the transmitter, receiver, and coupling circuits between the\\ntransmitter, receiver and sample coil.\\nThe transmitter power required to produce the necessary Hl field\\ndepends upon the range to be covered, and the effective size of the sampling\\nvolume. Achievement of the optimum level of 4 Gauss as calculated above\\nwould require large amounts of peak transmitter power (tens of kilowatts) if\\ndistances on the order of several tens of centimeters are to be covered. The\\nexact amount of power required can be determined once the size, configuration\\nand Q of the sample coil are specified. For this purpose, use can be made of\\nthe usual formulas for current flowing in loops or straight wire segments.\\nTo produce a field of 4 Gauss at a distance of 25 cm from a 5-cm-diameter\\ncoil having a Q of 6 requires a transmitter output peak pulse power on the\\norder of 250 kW but an average power of only 250 watts. Generation of such\\nlarge peak power and controlling it to be effectively turned on and off in the\\nnanosecond time regime is a very difficult undertaking. The approach utilized\\nin the program was to provide a transmitter output of much more modest levels\\nand accept the lower sensitivity which resulted from this limitation.\\nThe amplitude of the EMR signal to be expected from coal as a\\nfunction of distance away from the sample coil was also determined. Based on\\nan effective coal detection resolution (as determined by the gradient in the\\nmagnetic field) of 1.2 cm (0.5-in.) and a coil 5-can (2-in.) in diameter, the\\ncalculated EMR signal amplitude is as plotted in Figure 5. As may be seen,\\nthe signal level ranges from 2.5 mV for coal centered at a distance of 1-in.\\n(2.5 cm) from the sample coil down to 200 VV for coal at a distance of 10-in.\\n(25 am) from the sample coil. Thus, adequate system sensitivity to detect\\nand measure the thickness of coal over similar (0 to 10-in.) distance ranges\\nshould be obtained provided the optimum radiofrequency field intensity is\\nmaintained. Such optimum field conditions were assumed in the calculations.\\nOn the basis of this analysis and considerations, the possibility of the\\ntransient method being suitable for EMR detection of coal over the distance\\nranges appeared to be excellent. The primary problem appearing to be that\\nof obtaining sufficiently rapid recovery characteristics to permit detection\\nof the EMR signal within a few nanoseconds after the transmitter bursts.\\nAn experimental model based on these considerations was constructed and\\nevaluated.\\n4. Experimental Systems\\nThe transient EMR systems developed during this program were based\\non the block diagram shown in Figure 4. A number of variations in the design\\ndetails were evolved during the course of the work in attempts to overcome the\\nproblems and limitations which were encountered. These variations are des-\\ncribed in Appendix A.\\nThe radiofrequency generator produced either one or two pulse\\nbursts of 400 MHz signal (each of 25-40 nanoseconds duration and spacing)\\nwhich was amplified by the radiofrequency amplifiers to a level of 10 watts\\ni\\nt\\n3\\n2\\nr\\ti\\t\\nm\\t1\\nr-1\\n0.9\\n0.8\\n0.7\\na\\n.D\\trl\\n`n to M\\t0.6r-4Ln\\tto\\nC\\n.b\\' 0.5\\nEn\\n0.4\\nbv+jto\\n0.3\\nro\\nU\\n0.2\\n0.116\\nI\\n17-\\n,t\\nt\\ntI\\nt\\nI _!\\nt ,\\n, 1,\\n4I f -. } f 1i\\n\\' 1\\t1\\t I /- ^\\t1\\t\\n2-I\\n{^-,\\nr\\t-rt\\tT\\n•_ _ ^^ - -\\t,-rte- -.^ -^--^- -- ;r-t-1- -^ -+:-_\\n1\\tT _- r\\nt^^^i --1-ter .-\\nr.+ Lf--} t t ^^ -•- ^.\\n123456789\\t10\\nDistance in Inches\\nFIGURE 5.

This\\ncoil was located in close proximity to the coal or other material being\\nstudied. The output from the matching network was applied to the receiver\\nwhich boosted the signal amplitude and provided a detected output to an\\noscilloscope or recorder. The pulse sequencer controls the generator and\\ntiming of the pulses used to control the transmitter output as well as the\\nsampling and processing of the signal in the receiver.\\nA block diagram of the complete transient ESR system as finally\\ndeveloped is shown in Appendix A (Figure A-3). Detailed circuit diagrams\\nare also included in Appendix A. This system was used to demonstrate the\\ndetection of transient EMR signals in the laboratory using small samples\\nof diphenylpicralhydrazil (DPPH) in the sample coil. The previous work\\nhad shown the amplitude of the EMR response from an equal quantity of coal\\nto be 200 to 300 times weaker than that of DPPH and the linewidth to be\\ngreater by a factor of about 3 to 4. These two characteristics maze DPPH\\nconsiderably easier to detect than coal but use of this material was con-\\nvenient in that it allowed the signal to be obtained under marginal conditions\\nand used as an aid in adjusting the apparatus for optimum performance. These\\nresults are still consider---d to be very significant in that it was the first\\ntime that transient EMR detection had been demonstrated with any materials\\nat such low frequencies (400 MHz). However, after a considerable effort to\\noptimize the results, the performance of this system could still not be made\\nadequate for the intended application. The major limitation which restricted\\nfurther improvement was that of obtaining adequate separation of the desired\\nEMR signal from the pulsed transmitter signal. This resulted in the EMR\\nsignal being mixed with the residual transmitter signal and greatly limited\\nthe available sensitivity. Small changes in the tuning of the sample coil\\nand vari4tions in the position of material in proximity to the sample coil\\ngreatly affected the phase and amplitude of this residual transmitter signal.\\nMeans for minimizing this effect were investigated and incorporated in the\\nmodel, but since further improvements did not appear to be forthcoming, an\\nalternate transient approach used in a self-detecting pulsed oscillator was\\nevaluated. Details of the circuits and evaluation are included in Appen-\\ndix B.\\nWith the optimized gated oscillator system as shown in Figure\\nB-2, signals could be detected from DPPH at ranges up to about 2-inches\\nfrom the sensing coil. It was also found possible to detect a usable\\ntransient EMR response from powdered coal located within the sensing coil\\nbut the response from a block of coal (about 3\" x 5\" x 1\") (7.5 cm x 12.5 cn.\\nx 2.5 cm) located adjacent to the coil was very weak.\\nThe foregoing results indicated the need for a very significant\\nimprovement in system sensitivity if coal were to be detected at distances\\nup to several inches away from the apparatus. Such capability is essential\\nfor coal thickness gauging over similar distances. Except for the possibi-\\nlities of going to a much higher frequency, the prospects for achieving\\nimproved sensitivity with the transient EMR apparatus were not encouraging.\\n18\\nIn an effort to provide a better solution to the problem, an alternate means\\nof implementing the EMR detection was investigated for this application. This\\ndual frequency method, as will be described in a following Section (C), pro-\\nduced very encouraging results in initial tests.\\n5. Experimental Results\\nAs mentioned in the foregoing section, considerable difficulties\\nwere encountered in producing a sufficiently clean pulse burst from the radio-\\nfrequency transmitters. Figure 6 illustrates some of the results achieved\\nin this regard. In Figure 6 a the output from the intermediate power amplifier\\nis shown. This exposure was made with a high-frequency sampling type scope\\nwith the result that while the envelope of the wave is clearly indicated, the\\nindividual cycles are not seen because of the lack of synchronization. However,\\nthe envelope exhibits a very clear characteristic of the type generally desired.\\nF,-)r normal purposes, this would be more than adequate but for detection of the\\ntransient FMR response which must occur within a few tens of nanoseconds after\\nthe end of the pulse burst, the hangover signal is still significant and may\\nbe readily seen if the gain of the oscilloscope is increased to many times\\nthat utilized for Figure 6 a. These low-level signals which follow the main\\nbursts are insignificant for most purposes but are frequently many times the\\namplitude of the transient EMR signal even with a relatively clean wave shape\\nsuch as that shown in the picture. Figure 6b and Figure 6c show output\\nsignals obtained from the rad-ofrequency power amplifier when driven by the\\nwave shape such as in Figurc 6 a from the intermediate power stage. These\\npictures were made with a normal high-frequency oscilloscope and the wave form\\nof the individual cycles is readily apparent as well as is the shape of the\\nenvelope. Figure 6 b was made with a very short pulse input typically on the\\nordar of 10 nanoseconds. The major part of the output burst is also of a\\nsimilar duration. However, the rounded edges on both the leading and trailing\\nedge: may be seen, and more importantly, the hang-on signal having a nominal\\nfrequency of 160 MHz which follows this burst is also readily apparent. This\\nsignal caused severe interference to the detection of EMR signal ,.. Figure 6c\\nshows the output under similar conditions except that the input pulse burst is\\nlonger, and consequently, the output pulse obtained from the power amplifier\\nis significantly greater in length. The spurious output following the end of\\nthe transmitter burst, however, is still apparent and still of very large\\namplitude. Considerable efforts were directed toward overcoming this problem\\nbut a completely satisfactory solution was never developed. The residual\\nsignal is apparently characteristic of the modular amplifier that was em-\\nployed and results from internal resonances in that device. A filter with\\nsufficient selectivity to reject these components restricted the bandwidth\\nand caused additional problems in ringing at other frequencies.\\nFigure 7 shows transient EMR detector signals.

Figure 7b shows\\ntwo superimposed traces. Each of these was obtained at the output of the video\\namplifier at different magnetic field levels. One trace, the larger amplitude\\ntrace, was made at a magnetic field intensity of 143 Gauss at which point the\\nresonance conditions for electronn in DPPH was established. The smaller ampli-\\ntude trace was made at a magnetic field intensity of 141 Gauss. The difference\\nbetween the two traces represents the effect of the transient EMR signal ob-\\ntained from DPPH superimposed on top of the residual circuit signal that was\\npresent with or without a sample. The difference between the two, however,\\ndoes show a substantial transient EMR response which is well above normal cir-\\ncuit noise. However, in practice it was difficult to use since it was so\\nobscured by being smaller in amplitude than the residual circuit signals.\\nFigure 8 shows the amplified output from the gated oscillator-\\ndetector obtained with a sample of DPPH. For this exposure, the circuit was\\noperated at a quench frequency of 4.2 MHz and the circuit which used a U-310\\nFET followed by a 2N6550 low-noise amplifier was o perating at a frequency of\\n400 MHz. For this picture, the magnetic field was being swept at a rate of\\n9 Hz about the nominal resonance level of magnetic field intensity. The larger\\nnegative peak is the central resonance of the E.;It response while on each side,\\nthe smaller peaks are the sidebands spaced at the quench frequency of 4.2 MHz\\non either side of the EMR resonance. The total magnetic field sweep range in\\nthis case was approximately 4 Gauss and was of sinusoidal form. The oscillo-\\nscope horizontal was swept in synchronism with this magnetic field sweep. The\\nresult that subsequent sweeps are reproduced nearly on top of each other but\\nsignals were very good. With this system, the EMR response from DPPH could be\\ndetected when the sample was at a distance of 2-in. from the coil. The EMR\\nresponse from a block of coal (7.5 cm x 12.5 ,n x 2.5 cm) located adjacent to\\nthe coil could also be detected, but the response in this case was very weak.\\nThis was accomplished using a synchronous phase-lock detector as previously des-\\ncribed and direct observation on the oscilloscope in real-time was not possible.\\nC. Dual-Frequency System\\n1. General\\nIn the development of sensitive magnetic resonance detection\\napparatus, one of the major problems is to excite the electrons (or nuclei)\\nwith a sufficient transmitter power to obtain optimum results while at the\\nsame time maintaining a maximum level of sensitivity in the receiver. Since\\nthe transmitter signal level is normally many orders of magnitude greater\\nthan that of the spin resonance signal to be detected, steps must be taken\\nto prevent the transmitter signal from appearing at the receiver input where\\noverloading would almost certainly occur. In early continuous wave systems\\nthis was achieved by operating a detection coil in a balanced bridge circuit\\nsuch that the transmitter energy appeared at the sample coil but was\\n\"balanced\" out or \"nulled\" into a low-level at the receiver input. The\\nbridge, however, allowed the EMR signal from a sample to reach this receiver\\nA4\\nbe acceptable. With these encouraging results the system transmitter was\\nmodified to use the gated MECL oscillator and one of the double balance\\nmixers was used as a passive doubler to convert the 200 MHz output from\\nthe gated oscillator to 400 MHz. A pulse envelope of acceptable shape\\ncharacteristics was obtained] however, problems were encountered with the\\nlevel of the fundamental (200 MHz) and third harmonic component (600 MHz)\\nin the output. Attempts to reduce the amplitude of these spurious com-\\nponents by filtering were not fully effective.\\nIn addition to the above mentioned problem with harmonic content, a\\ntroublesome spurious signal was found to be present in the output of the\\nmodular 1OW power amplifier. This signal persisted for a period of 40 nano-\\nseconds following the second pulse burst and caused severe interference to\\nthe EMR detection. The frequency of this unwanted signal was about 160 MHz\\nand it appeared to be generated by one of the (apparently undamped) resonant\\ncircuits in the sealed amplifier module. Efforts to correct this problem\\nby filtering and optimization of the operating conditions resulted in a con-\\nsiderable improvement, but were not completely successful.\\nIn the preliminary evaluation of the entire EMR detection system it was\\nfound, as had been expected, that the receiver input was overloaded by the\\ntransmitter burst. However, it was also discovered that the overload recov-\\nery time of the modular integrated circuit amplifiers used in the receiver\\nwere excessive and that this characteristic could not be substantially changed\\nby external means. To overcome the problem, the input circuits were revised\\nto use discrete components and a low noise, wide dynamic range E-310 FET in\\ns circuit that off,-ed reduced recovery time and increased freedom from over-\\nload. Active gating and damping was also incorporated in the circuit to\\nfurther improve the receiver, but adequate results could not be obtained.\\nThe breadboard system was then modified to the homodyne receiver design.\\nThe homodyne offered the advantages of an inherently wide dynamic range and\\na tolerance for high levels of on-frequency signals. These features reduced\\nthe need for a high degree of protection from the transmitter overload and\\ngreatly reduced the requirements for complete elimination of leakage from\\nthe transmitter between pulse bursts. This receiver with the gated crystal\\ncontrolled transmitter proved to be a successful combination and allowed\\ntransient EMR signals to be detected in diphenylpicralhydrazil (DPPH).\\nSeveral means for coupling the transmitter and the receiver to the\\nsample coil were investigated to achieve improved results. Problems were\\nencountered in obtaining adequate efficiency to allow good signal transfer\\nwhile at the same time obtaining good isolation between the transmitter and\\nthe receiver over a wide bandwidth. The best results were obtained through\\nthe use of an Anzac wideband power divider type hybrid junction.\\nA block diagram of the complete transient ESR system as finally developed\\nis shown in Figure A-3. This system used the transmitter of Figure A-2.

The circuit diagram is shown in Figure B-1. The pulse burst\\ngenerated by the oscillator had rise and fall times of about 5 nanoseconds\\nand the burst length was adjusted to be on the order of 40 nanoseconds. A\\nrepetition rate of 1 MHz or higher was found to produce optimum results.\\nOperation of this type detector is based on the effects of the transient\\n(FID) EMR signal intensity with the coil to affevt the decay characteris-\\ntics of the bursts of oscillation. The circuit of the detector is very\\nsimple compared to those previously used for the transient EMR and the re-\\nsults were found to be far superior in both inherent stability and usable\\nsensitivity. EMR signal levels on the order of 50 mV were obtained directly\\nfrom the oscillator-detector when a sample of DPPH was placed in the coil.\\nWith the addition of a law noise video amplifier, shown in Figure B-1 on\\nthe output of the oscillator-detector it was found possible to detect a\\nsample of DPPH at a distance of nearly 2-in. outside the sample coil. This\\nwas achieved with a real-time display of the signal on an oscilloscope.\\nCoal could not be detected directly with the gated oscillator circuit alone\\neven though the several variables that affected performance -- such as the\\npower supply voltage, the oscillator gating voltage, wave shape, pulse rate,\\nand the circuit time constant- - had been optimized using DPPH. To further\\nimprove the sensitivity and attempt to obtain signals from coal at short\\ndistances away from the sample coil, the gated oscillator-detector was com-\\nbined with a lock-in amplifier to form the system shown as a block diagram\\nin Figure B-2. By use of this system, which provided modulation of the mag-\\nnetic field intensity and a synchronous phase-lock detector to process the\\nsignal from the EMR system, 3L was found possible to detect the transient\\nEMR response from a sample of powdered coal located in the sensor coil.\\nThe EMR response from a block of coal (about 3-in. x 5-in. x 1-in. or 7.5 cm x\\n12.5 cm x 2.5 cm) located adjacent to the coil tnuld also be detected, but\\nthe response was very weak.\\nB2\\nI\\tiI^^^o 0\\tN O N li\\t L\\t li\\t\\noLA- ^.^T ^^ T .^ \\t OLL1 1-\\nA 7\\no\\t yo\\nLnt,\\nZ\\t^^N\\n11\\t\\nO^\\tO^\\nol^\\n0\\nMLn\\nY ^5L-j\\n^O0 O LL\\nri\\t\\nLL.O\\t ^\\n^_ Jly o0\\nT -o O L.O Oy ^^LA-\\nOa0LL\\nO\\t\\n^\\t Il^ill\\t\\nO\\tN O\\nI)\\t\\nO\\t\\nLL,Li\\tL^\\ty\\na a a^ M N N\\n-\\t - ^\\t illO <O<O\\nN_ O_ \\nLn\\nl ? \\\\ i\\nO y \\t Y\\nat0UW\\n1-\\nW\\nD\\nI\\nOH\\nJ\\nH\\nv\\n00WH\\nU)\\n0\\ns\\nc^\\nrr\\n0\\nMU\\nrr\\nL)\\ni\\nWIx\\nMC7\\nZ =LL) D\\nO\\t Z^j`^ 2\\n33\\nN\\nQ^CJ\\nd W OC J\\nZ 3w3 d\\nO mE a (A\\n<n\\n%0\\nM\\n11147\\t^\\nGJ\\nJNw\\nO\\tca\\nK OCowI--d\\nvJ a\\tAn 0CL\\tz -^ w w\\nE\\tw U c=zQ\\tO (A 4-4\\nN\\tO O > QEwJOa\\nH\\nw\\nz\\nU\\'\\naEEwHN\\nN\\nE\\nw\\nF-\\nw\\nHVf\\n2a\\nH\\nO\\nV\\nwH\\nw\\nD\\nO\\naJ\\nJ\\n(AO\\nin\\nw\\nLA-HQl7\\nO\\nE\\nQ\\nt^\\nQ\\n1-(\\n0\\nYVO\\nJ\\nm\\nN\\nw\\ncr\\nl7\\nHa1OO\\n1— D VC\\nZ u ed\\nw w1rd\\'\\nr\\n2 H., wa , o\\nao ^\\nAPPENDIX C\\nDUAL FREQUENCY APPARATUS\\nCl\\nA block diagram of the dual frequency experimental system developed\\nunder Part III of the contract to evaluate the use of EMR for coal thick-\\nness gauging is shown in Figure C-1. The system is basically the same as\\nthat given in Figure 1 (page 5), but differs in the: (1) frequency of\\noperation; (2) use of an electromagnet of U-shape to provide a measuring\\nfield which varies in intensity as a function of distance above the pole\\nfaces; (3) use of a common antenna for transmitting and receiving in lieu\\nof separate coils; (4) use of synchronous R.F. detection; and (5) provi-\\nsions for sweeping the magnetic field intensity to vary the location of\\nthe EMR sensing region relative to the plane of the pole faces.\\nFigure C-2 shows the sensing assembly composed of the magnet, H.F.\\ncoils and the UHF antenna. The sensitive detection region is located\\nabove the UHF sensing antenna. In this region, the coal or other mater-\\nial being measured is exposed to: (a) a UHF electromagnetic field of\\n442 MHz generated by the 10 watts of power connected to the dipole antenna;\\n(2) a 6.95 MHz magnetic field proA\\xad: ed by 50 watts of power fed to the\\nH.F. coils; and (3) the modulated and/or swept magnetic field produced by\\nvarying currents in the coils of the electromagnet. An EMR response from\\nthe coal (or other appropriate materials) is produced by that region which\\nis common to the three foregoing fields and in which the magnetic field\\nintensity is proper for resonance at the 442 MHz, the UHF transmitter fre-\\nquency, or at 435.05 MHz -- the difference frequency between the 442 MHz\\nUHF transmitter frequency and the 6.95 MHz HF transmitter frequency. The\\nEMR signal produced by the coal is detected by the receiver at the fre-\\nquency of 435.05 MHz. By varying the current in the electromagnet, the\\nsensitive (resonance) region can be produced at selected distances above\\nthe pole faces. Thus, by sweeping the current from near zero to the\\nhighest allowable value, the sensing region for the experimental system\\nwas variable from near the pole faces out to a separation distance of about\\n8-inches. By knowledge of the magnetic field as a function of current,\\nthe thickness of the coal can be determined, unless otherwise limited, by\\nnoting the current at which the onset and termination of EMR response\\noccurs. However, with the experimental system, the detection sensitivity\\nlimited the range over which a useful EMR signal could be obtained from\\ncoal to a distance of about 2--inches. The thickness of a layer of coal\\nless than 2-inches thick could be measured, but with thicker layers the\\nEMR signal decayed into the noise when the sensing region was located at\\ndistances greater than 2-inches.\\nFigure C-3 shows an outline drawing of the electromagnet and Figure\\nC-4 shows the power supply used to excite the magnet. This supply incor-\\nporated provisions for modulating the field current at low frequencies\\n(under 20 Hz) and for producing a linear ramp type of sweep.\\nThe radiofrequency and detector electronics portion of the experi-\\nmental system is shown in Figure C-5. The Duplexer (Decibel Products\\ntype DB-4072) is the lower portion of the larger assembly. The duplexer\\nallows to 10 watts of 442 MHz power from the transmitter to be efficiently\\nQ\\n^`Q( MN\\t (Y\\n^\\t ^ Sa&\\tC2\\nWJ lqv nb 21001 ^1 ^\\nra\\n^gti\\ni\\n9\\nN \\t f\"\\'\\n\\'^\\t NT .7 T\\nO\\t ^\\nN o\\n!1\\tN\\n96\\n^ O\\nA\\nv\\nI\\t I}\\n;f\\n0 C6\\nV\\nO\\ny ORIGTN!k T YA r.r ►c\\nor,\\t \"axx\\na\\nad\\naQ\\nawaxw\\naHQ\\nU\\ns\\nH\\n23\\nwithout great attenuation. This works quite well under laboratory conditions\\nbut the balance to achieve a high degree of isolation was very difficult to\\nmaintain over long time periods and in the presence of changing environmental\\nconditions or changing samples. It is, therefore, not considered to be readily\\nadaptable to field measurements. The transient instrumentation achieved the\\ndesired iso? Lion between transmitter and receiver since the transmitter was\\nturned on for only a short period and the NMR response was received or detected\\nat a time when the transmitter was not producing an output. Thus, the receiver\\nshould be designed to have high sensitivity, and, if sufficient protection was\\nprovided to prevent damage from the transmitter output, interaction would not\\nnormally occur. In the case of the transient EMR system, however, the require-\\nments for recovery times were extremely stringent and obtaining sufficiently\\nclean transmitter outputs free of residual spurious signals posed many serious\\nproblems. As a result, the transient approach, while very suited and widely\\nused for NMR detection, did not prove to be practical for the detection of\\ntransient EMR signals from coal.\\nA third detection concept provides the required high isolation\\nbetween the transmitter and receiver, but does not suffer from the limitations\\nof highly critical adjustment which is characteristic of the balanced bridge\\nmethod nor from the requirements for high peak powers, clean transmitter signal\\npulse bursts, and rapid recovery from overload. This method, the dual-frequency\\nconcept, had been previously developed at Southwest Research Institute for other\\napplications, and while it is somewhat more complex than the transient apparatus\\nit appeared to offer an ideal solution to the difficulties of detecting EMR\\nresponse from coal over great dis-ances and in the mining environment. For\\nthese reasons this method was considered for the coal thickness gauging appli-\\ncation and briefly investigated in Part II of the contract effort.\\nSince the unanticipated technical problems with the transient\\nmethod had depleted most of the available funds for Part II of the contract,\\nonly a minimum amount of effort was available for use in demonstrating the\\ndual-frequency concept. However, an experimental apparatus was assembled and\\nthe performance obtained with this rudimentary system was extremely encouraging.\\nThis method is illustrated by Figure 1 (page 5) and in the simplest form\\nrequires that the sample be irradiated with two radiofrequency signals which\\nare usually widely separated in frequency. The experimental apparatus at a\\nfrequency of 400 MHz was used for one excitation signal and a frequency of\\n5 MHz was used for the second excitation signal. When the magnetic field is\\nadjusted to the value for resonance, a mixing action occurs in the electrons\\nwhich causes sidebands to be generated at the sum and difference frequencies.\\nThus, by tuning the receiver to one of these sideband frequencies, i.e., 405\\nor 395 MHz, the EMR response can be detected. For other magnetic field\\nintensities and under ideal conditions, no signal component appears at the\\nsum and difference frequencies. Thus, by using a filter ahead of the receiver\\nwhich provides rejection or the transmitter frequency but passes the sideband\\nfrequency, the receiver is isolated from the transmitter. Under these con-\\nditions the receiver may be designed to be a normal low noise, continuous\\nwave type receiver of narrow bandwidths which can achieve maximum sensitivity.\\nIt should be mentioned that this mixing action occurs when the magnetic field\\n24\\nintensity is equal to that for electron resonance at 400 MHz, at 5 MHz, or\\nalso at the sum and difference frequencies. However, this multiple response\\ncondition should offer no serious problems for using the method for coal thick-\\nness gauging.\\n2. System Analysis\\nIn the basic system the output from the 400 MHz transmitter is\\napplied to a sample coil which is oriented perpendicular to the magnetic field\\nHo as would normally be the case for continuous wave detection. The output\\nfrom the 5 MHz transmitter is applied to separate sets of coils which are\\noriented to produce a field coaxial or parallel with the field Ho. Under\\nthese conditions the 5 MHz signal causes the magnetic field to be swept over\\na rznge at a 5 MHz rate. This, in essence, frequency modulates the ESR\\nresponse and results in the sideband generation. The level of the 5 MHz sig-\\nnal required for optimum results can be determined on the basis of FM theory\\nwhich shows a maximum sideband amplitude when B, the modulation index, equals\\n1.7 (6 is equal to the frequency deviation divided by the modulation frequency).\\nFor the modulation frequency of 5 MHz, the optimum peak value of the sinusoidal\\nmodu1-tion field amplitude would then be 8.5 MHz. Since the relationship\\nbetween the electron magnetic resonance frequency and the magnetic field is\\ngiven by y = 2.8 x 10 -6, the modulation of the magnetic field should have a\\npeak value of 8.5/2.8 or approximately 3 Gauss. Since the modulation coils\\nmay have a relatively high Q, the amount of power required to produce such\\nfield intensities is quite modest. The power requirement for the UHF trans-\\nmitter at 400 MHz may be determined on the basis of the saturation power density\\nof the electron resonance and is typically, on the size device being considered,\\non the order of a few watts. Lower power in either the case of the 5 MHz\\nmodulation transmitter field or the 400 MHz carrier field results in reduced\\nsensitivity but does not preclude the occurrence of the effect.\\nThe choice of the modulation frequency is arbitrary but somewhat\\nrestricted. The use of as high modulation frequency as possible is desirable\\nto ease the filtering requirements to provide sufficient isolation between the\\ntransmitter and the receiver. The use of a high frequency is also desirable\\nfor some applications where studies of line shapes is important to provide a\\nbetter separation between the magnetic field intensities where resonance occurs\\nat fo and at sideband frequencies. For the detection of EMR response in coal\\nand for the thickness gauging application, however, this is not an important\\nconsideration. The use of higher frequencies and higher transmitter powers\\nto produce the required modulation field intensities sets a limitation on the\\nmaximum that should be utilized. The choice used in the experimental model\\nof 5 MHz is a tradeoff between these two factors and appears to be a near\\noptimum choice.\\nThe power utilized in the 400 MHz transmitter and the experimental\\nmodel ranged from 1 watt to a maximum of approximately 10 watts. At the\\n10 watt level the resonances in the DPPH and coal samples, placed in the\\nsample coil, were tending to saturate and little improvement in results was\\nortained at 10 watts over that which was available with power levels of approxi-\\nmately 3 watts. As the separation distance between the sample coil and the\\nmaterial being measured is increased, advantages to usin g, higher power may\\nbecome more apparent.\\n25\\nIn the ideal situation, mixing between the 400 MHz frequency and\\nthe 5 MHz frequency only occurs in the sample material when exposed to magnetic\\nfields of the proper intensities to cause resonance in the electrons. In\\npractice, however, mixing between the two signals can occur in any nonlinear\\nmaterial that might be present in the fields of both coils with the result that\\na continuous sideband signal may appear at the receiver input. The occurrence\\nof this condition in the iron of the magnet and in other materials has been\\nobserved as has the production of the undesired mixing effect in nonlinear\\ncomponents in the transmitter output stages. For this reason some precautions\\nare necessary in the construction of the apparatus to minimize the possibility\\nof both frequencies appearing in undesired regions simultaneously. However,\\nby use of an additional modulation of the magnetic field, thL effects of the\\nnonlinear mixing in non-EMR resonant materials can be eliminated. This is\\nshown in Figure 1 and is accomplished by modulating the field at a frequency\\nof 18 Hz. This causes the EMR response to be modulated at 18 Hz and this\\ncomponent is available at the output of the selected receiver. The sideband\\nenergy that is caused by nonlinear mixing in non-resonant materials does not\\ncause an 18 Hz component to be present and, by arranging a lock-in amplifier\\nwhich is sensitive to only the 18 Hz component of the receiver output, the\\neffects of the nonlinear mixing may be rejected and the sole response pro-\\nduced by the EMR activity.\\n3. Demonstration System\\nA demonstration system was assembled for evaluation of the\\ndual-frequency concept in the laboratory. This system made use of the appara-\\ntus that was available and the performance could undoubtedly be greatly improved\\nby optimum design of the various components. This experimental system utilized\\nthe transmitter that had been developed for the transient cases and was pre-\\nviously described in Section II.B.4. It was modified for this application,\\nhowever, to produce a continuous wave output and power levels up to 10 watts\\nwere available. The output could be reduced to lower levels with attenuators.\\nThe 5 MHz transmitter made use of a commercially available tunable oscillator\\nto provide an output frequency of 5 MHz. This was connected through a broad-\\nband linear RF power amplifier which was set to produce an output power of\\n6 watts. The receiver was composed of a crystal-controlled frequency con-\\nverter tuned to 405 MHz. The output of this converter was connected to\\na Collins R388 communications receiver which was tuned to receive the side-\\nband frequencies. The audio output from the receiver was connected to the\\ninput of a lock-in amplifier tuned to 18 Hz. The 18 Hz oscillator in the\\nlock-in amplifier was connected to the magnet power supply to cause the\\nmodulation of the magnetic field superimposed on the main magnet field\\ncurrent which produced the resonant field Ho. This modulation was set to\\nprovide a field sweep at 18 Hz of less than the linewidth of the material to\\nbe detected and was typically on the order of 1 Gauss peak-to-peak.\\nThe magnet used for the laboratory studies provided a volume\\n5-in.-wide by 8-in.-deep by 8-in.-high in which the field intensity was homo-\\ngeneous to within 1%. The pair of coils used to provide the 5 MHz modulation\\nwere 4-in. in diameter and were tuned to resonance at 5 MHz and loaded to\\n26\\ngive a matched input impedance of 50 Ohms. The UHF sensor coil was the same\\nas that previously described and shown in Figure 12. This coil is 3/4-in.\\nin diameter. Sample material to be studied was placed in the magnetic field\\nand within the region modulated by the 5 MHz coils but was spaced away from\\nthe UHF transmitter coil at selected distances.\\nThe receiver coil, with a design similar to that of the UHF coil,\\nwas 2-in. in diameter and similarly loaded to be matched to a 50 Ohm line.\\nThe receiver coil was connected to a filter which rejected 400 MHz by approxi-\\nmately 40 dB but passed 405 MHz with only about 2 dB of insertion loss. The\\ndesign of this filter was based on the concept commonly employed as a duplexer\\nin communication systems where the transmitter and receiver operate at different\\nbut closely spaced frequencies and are connected to the same antenna. This\\nfilter rejected the 400 MHz transmitter component but allowed the EMR signal\\nat 405 MHz to pass to the input of the selective 405 MHz receiver.\\n4.Results with Demonstration System\\nThe demonstration dual-frequency system exhibited extremely en-\\ncouraging results. It was readily possible to detect the response from a\\nsample of DPPH located within a few inches of the UHF coil even when the\\nreceiver coil was separated from the magnet assembly by distances of several\\nfeet. Thus, the radiated EMR signal from the sample was being detected by\\nthe receiver coil over these distances. This detection was readily observed\\nwith DPPH samples of approximately 10 grams at separation distances from the\\nUHF coil of up to about 6-in. The EMR signal produced from a 10 gram sample\\nof coal placed near the UHF coil could be detected with the receiver coil up\\nto 10-in. away.\\nIn the initial dual-frequency system the 18 Hz modulation was not\\nutilized and the receiver S-meter was used as an indicator. Under these con-\\nditions the sideband was tuned in by the receiver, and was seen to appear and\\ndisappear as the field intensity of the electromagnet was varied through\\nresonance. Some instability and the effects of nonlinear mixing were observed\\nwhen operating in this manner, however. By use of the lock-in amplifier and\\nthe 18 Hz modulation, the instability and the effects of the nonlinear mixing\\nwere reduced to insignificant levels. In this case, as the magnetic field is\\ntuned through resonance the output indicator on the lock-in amplifier swings\\nfrom one extreme to the other as it traces out the shape of the EMR response.\\nThe shape is similar to those shown for the EMR samples studied in Part I\\nof the contract. The stability under these conditions was very good. On\\nthe basis of these findings, the use of the dual-frequency method as the\\nbasis for the coal thickness gauge appeared worthy of further development.\\n5.Experimental System\\nAn experimental EMR system suitable for evaluation of the coal\\nthickness gauging capability was developed under Part III of the contract.\\nThis system is described in detail in Appendix C.\\n27\\n6. Results with Experimental System\\nNumerous tests were conducted during the development of the\\nexperimental system to determine that the expected level of performance\\nof the various subsystems was being attained and to optimize these major\\ncomponents. These tests included such fundamental determinations of the\\npower outputs from the 442 and 6.95 MHz transmitters (10 and 50 watts,\\nrespectively), the receiver noise figure (2.5 dB) and the intensity of\\nthe magnetic field in the space above the pole faces. This is plotted\\nin Figure 9. In addition, several UHF antenna configurations were evalu-\\nated to determine the optimum design for achieving the maximum detection\\nrange. These structures investigated included a 3-inch diameter circular\\ncoil, a full-wave (at 442 MHz) rectangular loop, a half-wave dipole formed\\ninto a non-shorted circular loop as well as the linear half-wave dipole\\nwhich produced the best results and was adapted for the final design.\\nSeveral coil sizes of both rectangular and circular cross-sections were\\ninvestigated for use in generating the 6.95 MHz field. The design finally\\nadopted uses three turns of heavy teflon insulated wire enclosed in an\\nunshorted, 11-inch diameter, loop of copper tubing which acts as a Faraday\\nshield.\\nTests were conducted to establish the optimum power required for\\nthe high frequency (6.95 MHz) field and for the UHF (442 MHz) field. In-\\ncreases above 50 watts at 6.95 MHz produced insignificant improvements in\\nthe detection sensitivity; however, increases above the 10-watt level in\\nthe 442 MHz field would result in improved sensitivity, but, for safety\\nreasons, this was not considered advisable. Further tests were conducted\\nto determine the optimum frequency and amplitude for the magnetic field\\nmodulation.\\nInitial tests of the system produced very erratic results.\\nThis was found to be due to spurious coupling between the various subsys-\\ntems and was corrected by extensive shielding and RF filtering of all con-\\nnections into and out of the assemblies and sub-assemblies.\\nWith the final system, tests were conducted to show the level\\nof performance which could be achieved. Many preliminary tests for opti-\\nmization purposes were conducted with DPPH which provides a more intense\\nEMR signal than coal. However, tests were also conducted using blocks of\\ncoal approximately 3\" thick by 10\" square. This block of coal could be\\ndetected with a 2:1 signal-to-noise ratio (using a 1-second integration\\ntime) when placed above the sensing antenna (and magnetic pole faces)\\nat distances up to 2-inches. This distance is the separation between the\\nbottom of the block and the uppermost part of the sensing apparatus. At\\ngreater separation distances the EMR signal from the coal rapidly dropped\\ninto the noise. Other tests conducted with DPPH showed the capability to\\ndetect a change in the position of the lower interface (between the layer\\nof DPPH and air) as small as 0.04 inches.\\ni\\nyG!\\nU\\nI\\n.^I\\t W\\na°\\nvI\\no\\t ^\\nwO\\nU\\t A\\n^\\t d yJ\\t H\\ntll\\t ^4\\nQ\\nO^\\nHws I2e\\nO\\t O\\t O\\t O\\t O\\tO\\n%D\\t LA\\t M\\t N\\t r-I\\nSMPO - A4TSU94UI pToT3 otgaubvw\\nL\\t •\\n29\\nEfforts were made to determine the causes for the limited\\ndetection range and means whereby it could be increased. The perfor-\\nmance of each system component was re-examined, but all were found to\\nbe operating as expected. To further explore the possibility of obtain-\\ning extended detection distances, and consequently greater thickness\\ngauging ranges, tests were conducted with the UHF sensing antenna and\\nthe HF modulation coils placed in a large electromagnet of the design as\\nwas shown in Figure 1 to allow measurements to be made with the sample in\\na more homogeneous magnetic field. This magnet provides a field which is\\nof constant intensity, to within It over a voluma which is 16\" high x 26\"\\nwide and 20\" deep. In this field, the EMR signals from the block of coal\\ncould be detected with a 2:1 signal-to-noise ratio at separation distances\\nfrom the sensing antenna of up to 8-inches. Other than the magnetic field,\\nthe system was the same for these tests as for those c a_^,Lucted earlier.\\nThis indicates that the system is basically capable of detecting the EMR\\nresponse from coal at distances of interest for in situ thickness gauging\\nprovided a favorable magnetic field is used. This indicates the need to\\nmodify the present magnet configuration to achieve such improvements in a\\nfieldable instrument.\\n30\\nIII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\\nThe feasibility of using electron magnetic resonance (EMR) as the\\nbasis for gauging the thickness of coal overlaying a rock substrate has\\nbeen investigated. As a result of this work, it may be concluded:\\n1.The capability of FMR to distinguish coal from rock\\n(and air) has been established.\\n2.If properly implemented, EMR is basically suitable for\\nuse as a noncontacting means for detecting the front,\\ncoal-air, interface as well as the rear, coal-rock, inter-\\nface of the layer of coal remaining in place after a cut\\nby mining machinery.\\n3.Three different EMR detection methods have been investi-\\ngated for use in coal thickness gauging. The balanced\\nbridge continuous-wave method has been demonstrated to\\nhave excellent detection sensitivity in laboratory appli-\\ncations, but requires critical adjustments which could\\nbe difficult to maintain in a moving environment. The\\nsecond method, the transient app-oach, offers the poten-\\ntial of being a sensitive non-critical means for detecting\\nthe EMR response from coal; however, the short decay time\\nconstants (a few nanoseconds) which characterize the EMR\\nresponse from coal impose serious recovery time problems\\nin the apparatus which are very difficult to overcome\\nwithout going tc operating frequencies in the upper micro-\\nwave range where the magnetic field intensity requirements\\nfor resonance may be excessive. The third method, the\\ndual frequency approach, offers a better combination of\\ncharacteristics than the other two. It is relatively non-\\ncritical in adjustment, useful at relatively low frequen-\\ncies and suitable for sensitive detection. However, the\\ncoils used for generation of the high intensity radio-\\nfrequency field parallel to the D.C. magnetic field intro-\\nduces some mech;-nical design complications.\\n4.The detection of coal at separation distances from the\\nEMR sensor of up to 8-inches has been demonstrated in\\nhomogeneous magnetic fields using the dual frequency\\nmethod.\\n5.Means for using gradient fields with EMR to allow thick-\\nness gauging to be achieved have been developed and the\\ncapability to detect both a front and rear coal-air inter-\\nface have been demonstrated.\\n31\\n6.Detection of coal-air interfaces at separation distances\\nup to 2-inches from the EMR sensor with a resolution of\\n0.04-inches has been achieved in a gradient field using\\nthe dual frequency detection method.\\n7.Further improvements in the EMR detection apparatus are\\nneeded to extend the detection range to distances of 6\\nto 8inches or more for mining applications of the coal\\nthickness gauge. Such improvements should be attainable\\nsince detection at such ranges has been demonstrated with\\nEMR in homogeneous fields.\\nIt is therefore recommended that the detection apparatus be modified\\nto increase by a factor of 3 to 4 the measurement distance range over which\\ncoal thickness gauging can be achieved. Such an improvement should be\\nrealized with the following recommended modifications:\\n1.Alter the magnet design to provide a lower field gradient\\nat the measurement range. This will increase the effec-\\ntive volume of the coal which is sensed and thereby im-\\nprove the signal-to-noise ratio. Even with this change,\\nthe thickness measurement resolution can still be made to\\nbe 0.5 inches or better.\\n2.Increase the magnetic field intensity and the associated\\nEMR frequency to approximately twice that now being\\nwed. This will provide an S,/N improvement of 4:1 and\\nincrease the measurement range by an estimated factor of\\n2:1.\\n3.Increase the modulation frequency to be more optimum for\\ncoal and proportionately increase the available modulation\\npower.\\n4.Incorporate more advanced signal processing methods to\\nbetter extract the desired signal from the noise.\\nx\\n32\\nREFERENCES\\n1.Blume, R.J., \"Electron Spin Relaxation Times in Sodium Ammonia\\nSolutions,\" Physical Review, Vol. 109 (1958) p. 1867.\\n2.Kaplan, D.E., Browne, M.E., and Cowen, J.

However, all of these designs were based on the block\\ndiagram shown in Figure 4 (page 12).\\nTo obtain good frequency stability, the transmitter frequency was\\ncrystal controlled and produced a peak power output of 10 watts. The trans-\\nmitter pulse width was adjustable over the range of 25 to 40 nanoseconds,\\nand the spacing between the pulse pairs was adjustable over a similar range.\\nA pulse rise and fall time of 3 nanoseconds was set as an additional goal.\\nIn the original design the receiver was composed of three stages of low noise\\nhybrid type amplifiers coupled by bandpass circuits to provide the required\\n60 MHz bandwidth and a noise figure of under 4 dB. Due to overload problems\\nand undesirable transient response characteristics which were encountered,\\nthe receiver was modified to a homodyne circuit using no radiofrequency\\namplification ahead of the double balance mixer. However, the mixer was\\nfollowed by a low noise video amplifier. The original matching network was\\na balanced bridge hybrid made from sections of coaxial cable. Because of\\nthe narrow bandwidth this was later modified to a resistive bridge and\\nfinally, to a broadband hybrid network to improve the operation of the system.\\nA block diagram of the original transmitter or radiofrequency generator\\nis shown in Figure A-1. The radiofrequency signal begins as a continuously\\nrunning crystal controlled 133 MHz oscillator. The output of this oscillator\\nis tripled to 400 MHz. In the initial design the 400 MHz output from the\\ntripler was directly connected through a 90 0 power splitter to two RF gate\\ncircuits. The RF gates made use of double balanced mixers especially selected\\nfor high RF attenuation. The two output signals provided by the power split-\\nter are at 0 0 and 900 relative phase angles and both are needed for the pulse\\necho detection sequence. Each signal is connected to a double balanced mixer\\ngate which is controlled by pulses from the sequencer to generate the bursts\\nof 400 MHz energy. The pulse burst outputs of the two mixers are combined\\nl\\t and amplified through a low-power broadband, modular amplifier. The output\\nis then further amplified through a modular power amplifier to an output\\nlevel of 10 watts peak into a 50-Ohm load. Problems were initially encoun-\\ntered with the leakage between transmitter bursts being of sufficiently\\nhigh level that the receiver was saturated. To reduce this leakage, an\\namplifier and the second gated mixer were added between the tripler and the\\nphase splitter. This modified transmitter circuit is shown in Figure A-2.\\nThe changes significantly increased the on/off ratio but the need for still\\nfurther isolation was apparent from the results.\\nGated oscillators using an MECL-III NAND gate were investigated as an\\nalternate means for obtaining such improvements. Oscillation could not be\\nobtained with this device at 400 MHz1 however, by using a delay line circuit\\nfeedback, controllable, nanosecond lengths of oscillation could he obtained\\nat frequencies as high as 280 MHz. The rise time for this gated oscillator\\nwas found to be 3 nanoseconds while the fall time was 5 nanoseconds and sig-\\nnificant spurious signals following the pulses persisted for only 10 to 15\\nnanoseconds. The shape and recovery time characteristics also appeared to\\nA3\\nOSCILLATOR\\nI400 MHZ FILTER\\nTRIFLER\\tAMP\\nRF GATE\\nMCL SAM-5 \\tTO DBM\\nPOWER SPLITTER\\nCL PSCQ-2-400\\t\\nMCL SAM-5\\t MCL SAM-5\\n\\t0° GATE \\t 1\\t 1\\t 90° GATE\\n00\\nMPOWER COMBINER\\nMCL MSC 2-1\\nCLASS \"A\" 1 PA\\nTRW CA2820\\nCLASS \"C\" AMP \\tOUTPUT\\nMotorola SHW 208 \\t 400 Mtiz\\nOo\\t 90°\\nOFFS\\nREPETITION RATE \\t DELAY LINE\\nGEN\\t PULSE GEN\\nSync\\nPULSE GENDELAY\\nPULSELGEN\\tr-ol\\tPULSE GENE\\nFIGURE A-2.

This causes the 442 MHz transmitter power at the receiver\\ninput to be about 75 dB less than that fed to the antenna or a level of\\n-35 dBm. The other parts of the R.F. circuits, see the block diagram, are\\nenclosed in the upper part of the larger assembly except for the 6.95 MHz\\noscillator-power amplifier.\\nThe 6.95 MHz unit is the smaller assembly in Figure C-5. A circuit\\ndiagram of this unit is shown in Figure C-6. The circuit uses a crystal\\ncontrolled oscillator which produces a low level output. This is ampli-\\nfied through a series of transistor stages to a level (+7 dBm) suitable\\nfor use as a double balanced mixer reference. The signal is further\\namplified by a tuned power transistor in a narrow band circuit. Output\\nlevels of up to 50 watts continuous to a nominal 50 ohm load are avail-\\nable from this 6.95 MHz transmitter. This is connected through a coaxial\\ncable up to 20 feet long to the HF coils in the Sensing Assembly. A dual\\ncapacitor netow rk times these coils to resonance at 6.95 MHz and provides\\na nominal input impedan--e of 50 ohms.\\nThe 435.05 output `rom the duplexer (EMR signal) is coupled through a\\nnarrow bandpass filter (tit MHz bandwidth) to the input of the low noise\\n(2.5 dB noise figure) dual gate MOSFET RF amplifier in the receiver as shown\\nin the block diagram, Figure C-1, and in the circuit diagram, Figure C-7.\\nThe 435.05 MHz output of the amplifier goes to a double balanced mixer\\n(SRA-3) where it is mixed with the 44. MHz reference from the oscillator-\\ntripler to form a synchronous detector having a phase coherent 6.95 MHz\\noutput. This output is amplified in two amplifier stages . The bandwidth\\nof this amplifier is about 200 kHz.\\nNext, the signal is fed to a second tuned amplifier which also uses a\\ntype 40673 dual-gate MOSFET as shown in Figure C-8. The output of this\\nstage is coupled to another double balanced mixer (DBM) which uses the\\nreference from the 6.95 MHz oscillator-amplifier to maintain the phase\\ncoherent detection. The output of the DBM is the low frequency modulation\\nof the magnetic field. This is amplified in two IC amplifier stages to\\nraise thelevel for direct observation on an oscilloscope or for connection\\nto the input of a lock-in amplifier. The lock-in amplifier produces the\\nreference output used to modulate the magnetic field at a low frequency.\\nThe low frequency was normally on the order of 5 Hz and the magnetic field\\nmodulation level at the coal being measured was typically 3-gauss peak-to-\\npeak.\\nThe 442 MHz transmitter uses a crystal controlled (147.3 MHz) oscilla-\\ntor followed by a transistor frequency triplex. This is shown in Figure\\nC-6 and the circuit diagram is shown as part of Figure A-4 (Appendix A).\\nThe intermediate power amplifier (IPA) and the Power Amplifier are the same\\nas used for the transient EMR work and are shown in Figure A-5 (Appendix A).\\nThe power output level is 10 watts (+40 dBm).\\nC8\\n.^ 7\\nZ\\t _--^\\t`I ^ \\t^ N ^j I ZW,3\\t I\\ti\\t Q\\n^Y\\n+—m \\t Z\\t II\\t W\\nEnh i\\t •\\t ^n.^ I I I\\t ^i N\\'ti ^(^\\t W\\n\\tv \\t yy^ I I\\t\\nV\\t ^\\t W^\\t\\n^II oc \\t\\nHI\\ni ^w\\n\\\\ ^\\t ^^ I I ^^\\' \\t I\\tr^\\t\\nZ\\t N\\t\\n^\\t ^n\\nI\\t M\\nn,\\nZ\\t 6\\t N\\nF--H I\\' m F v\\tLn\\n> c\\t ^^\\nILN\\tO\\t WTa\\t a\\t\\nIP\\tj\\t\\nI\\t ^\\t I\\nI\\t\\nI\\t f\\t ^ ^ \\t 11\\nC\\nZ\\t \\'I,\\t\\n^\\t —\\t J\\t\\n•\\t^n\\t ^\\t nn\\nZI\\nV..^ v\\n1\\nQ ^CQ\\nTH It\\nI\\'\\t I^\\ni\\n2 V \\nw I\\nG\\nI\\'\\nO_\\nQ\\nRd\\naaH\\na\\na\\naM\\nUNO\\nfarE-\\'HE\\nQ\\nawxH\\n1\\naw\\nWU\\nr\\n1U0C9\\ni\\nQRIGIN C PArr r^ iy\\n1\\nd ^j\\nOb\\nW\\t ^I\\'\\na>rg\\nI\\'\\nV\\tz\\n^:\\t h\\na Q\\nU\\nJ^ ^^ ♦\\t o\\t o ^ I\\ntdt,\\nHI\\t—^1^11o\\t ^\\'\\n4\\t•–\\t n\\nV\\t ^\\nw ^\\'\\nCL\\t I\\nN\\n(71\\tu^ l\\nI\\'\\nI\\'\\nG\\tO\\n•\\tI\\tO_\\nN\\no , Q\\t I\\t Kl\\n2 S\\t Y\\t I, {\\t\\n`\\t o0\\t\\n1\\t I\\'\\ncoo\\n14\\nT\\'e\\t <\\\\Q \\t ^,\\nL\\t1C\\n-\\nY\\tY\\t^Y\\nC\\t ^^\\t I\\nC\\nRI\\t vIK\\n^I \\t ~\\ny^\\t n\\nN\\t^ l\\t ^,\\n^\\t 3\\nC\\t\\nC\\tr\\nf\\t ,-1 \\t 1\\n^ ^ \\tc\\n.Y..,.. r .. \\t oZ4\\nn\\nu\\nc\\nA\\nSa\\nwN\\nwHa\\na\\nL)\\nR\\nsQza\\na\\nw\\n^a\\n0\\n1\\na\\nwN\\n1.4\\nN\\na\\nN\\nLn\\nO^\\nco\\n1\\nU\\nH\\n']\n",

Truscello and A.

Project emphasis is on the development of\\ncost-effective systems which will accelerate the commercialization and\\nindustrialization of plants up to 10 MWe, using parabolic dish collectors.\\nThe characteristics of PFDR systems and the cost targets for major sub-\\nsystems hardware are identified. Markets for this technology and their\\nsize are identified, and expected levelized bus bar energy costs as a\\nfunction of yearly production level are presented. Finally, the present\\nstatus of the technology development effort is discussed.\\nII-1\\n1.\\tIntroduction\\nThe solar thermal power systems work at JPL is sponsored by the\\nDepartment of Energy, Thermal Power Systems Branch, for the purpose of\\ndeveloping systems capable of competitive-priced thermal and electric\\nenergy for utility, industrial, and isolated applications. Program res-\\nponsibility resides with DOE Headquarters and project management with JPL,\\nwith engine and power conversion support provided by NASA Lewis Research\\nCenter.\\nThree princiFal configurations for thermal power systems being devel-\\noped by DOE are the central receiver (CR), the line focus distributed\\nreceiver (LFDR), aid the point focus distributed receiver (PFDR). The JPL\\nwork is based on a PFDR system with paraboloidal dish and integral\\nreceiver. This tec, ,nology is expected to be initially applied to rela-\\ntively small power systems (up to a few megawatts) made up of .identical\\nmodules (each a few tens of kilowatts in capacity). Each module is capable\\neither of generating electricity, or of supplying heat for industrial pur-\\nposes, depending on the type of receiver used. A representative dish con-\\nfiguration is shown in Figure 1.\\nFor electric applications the module consists of three subsystems:\\nthe concentrator, the receiver, and the power conversion :snit. An auto-\\nmatic control system enables each module to track the sun across the sky\\nevery day. The concentrator collects solar energy from a large area and\\nfocuses it to a very small area. The receiver, which is mounted at the\\nfocal point, captures the concentrated radiation, and converts the energy\\nto heat in a working fluid, such as hot gas. The working fluid transports\\nthe energy to the heat engine of the power conversion unit, which is\\nmechanically linked to the electric generator. In the simplest configura-\\ntion of the system, the power conversion unit is located atop the receiver,\\nat the fetus. The optical portion of the concentrator is a parabolic\\nreflector, although lens concentrators are also being considered. To\\nproduce thermal energy for industrial, commercial, or agricultural applica-\\ntions, the power conversion unit is replaced with an appropriate receiver\\nhaving flexible lines to conduct the working fluid to a heat transfer net-\\nwork on the ground.\\nTI-3\\nPRECEDING PAGE CLANK NOT\\nPOWER CONVERTER\\nFigure 1. Dish Concentrator with Power Converter at the Focus\\nII-4\\nx\\nThe principal advantages of the parabolic dish system and its charac-\\nteristics are discussed below.\\n2.\\tPoint Focus Distributed Receiver (PFOR)\\nAdvantages\\nThe thermal power systems project at JPL began wcrk under DOE sponsor-\\nship in June 1977. Prior studies by JPL under NASA funding had established\\nPFDR systems as the solar thermal approach having the potential for pro-\\nducing low-cost energy. The principal advantages of dish solar concen-\\ntrators are (1) the high temperatures attainable, (2) the inherent modu-\\nlarity of dish collectors, (3) the ease of collecting the power output of\\neach dish in electrical form, and (4) the high percentage of the available\\nsolar insolation which is collected. The high temperatures available from\\ndish systems results from their inherently high concentration ratio.\\nThe attractiveness of the high temperature characteristic of dish\\nsystems arises from both the higher conversion efficiency achievable from\\nheat engines as the temperature of the working fluid is increased and the\\nwide range of temperatures achievable for thermal applications. The\\nattractiveness of the inherent modularity of dishes with integral power\\nconverter at the focus lies in the strong potential for reduction in manu-\\nfacturing costs as mass production experience evolves. For solar thermal\\ndish systems to compete successfully with fossil fuels will require sub-\\nstantial progress in reducing manufacturing costs. Modularity facilitates\\nthis process, and in addition offers low risk during the development phases\\nbecause it permits full-scale experiments with small hardware modules.\\nModularity also offers power plant growth on a flexible and incremental,\\nbuilding block, basis; performance is insensitive to plant power level.\\nThese features are summarized in Table 1.j\\nII-5\\nTABLE 1. WHY PFDR TECHNOLOGY\\n0\\t TWO-AXIS COLLECTION\\n•\\tHIGH CONCENTRATION \\tHIGH TEMPERATURE\\nHIGH CONVERSION EFFICIENCY\\n•\\tELECTRIC TRANSPORT\\n•\\tWIDE TEMPERATURE RANGE HEAT PRODUCTION\\n•\\tMODULAR MASS PRODUCTION\\nThe ready adaptability of dishes to two-axis tracking insures maximum\\nutilization of the direct beam radiation at near maximum efficiency from\\nsun up to sun down. Two-axis tracking combined with the high geometric\\nconcentration ratio provides high temperatures at the focus, which in turn\\nallows high efficiencies to be derived from Brayton or Stirling heat engine\\npower converters. PFDR systems offer broad applicability, including both\\nsmall and large utilities, power for remote sites, agriculture (especially\\npumping), and a wide range of industrial and commercial process heat appli-\\ncations.\\nVersatility as shown in Figure 2 is a key attribute of solar thermal\\nsystems, especially of dishes because of their high temperature potential.\\nVersatility can be illustrated in terms of the end product produced: elec-\\ntricity, process heat, steam, chemicals and fuels.\\nWith a power conversion unit consisting of a heat engine, alternator\\nand receiver attached at the focus, electricity is produced. With only a\\nreceiver at the focus, steam or industrial process heat can be supplied.\\nAlso the dish units can be thermally coupled to supply high quality heat to\\na conventional power plant in a repowering mode. Combining engine and\\nthermal transport allows these units to be used in cogeneration applica-\\ntions. Also, by adapting the receiver design to match the particular fuel\\nor chemical to be produced, the dish system is adaptable to a wide range of\\nchemical processes.\\nII-6\\n\\t\\nr\\t610-FUEL\\nI 17 -\\n``\\t •ALCOHOL\\t\\n-1.\\t 1\\t •METHANEGAS OR OIL\\nS\\nPARABOLIC DISH\\nPOWER PLANTS\\nHEAT \\tELECTRICITY\\n^4%LJU\\nrSYNTHETIC \\t CHEMICALS s\\t INDUSTRIAL\\nFUELS\\t PROCESS\\nHEAT\\nFigurE 2. Versatility of Parabolic Dish Power Plants\\nConsidering flexibility in terms of operational modes, dish systems\\ncan readily be designed to provide for hybrid operation in which conven-\\ntional fuels provide heat on a transient or steady state basis to com-\\npensate for variations in insolation. Along with the hybrid operational\\ncapability, there is the potential for using numerous conventional fuels.\\nA potentially attractive hybrid mode is the coupling of the solar plant to\\na biomass system to supply it with low Btu biogas proi juced by a digestive\\nprocess. The most appropriate fuel would be selected for each application.\\n3.\\tMarket Size and Project Goals\\nThe primary goals of the pr.)ject are (1) to produce electricity or\\nheat at a cost competitive with conventional alternatives, and (2) to\\ndevelop the technical and economic readiness of cost-effective PFDR tech-\\nnology necessary to accelerate market penetration of small power systems.\\nMarket penetration requires a mature technology coupled with favorable pre-\\nconditions within the commercial and industrial infrastructures which\\ngovern the effectiveness of supply and demand forces. To facilitate the\\nestablishment of preconditions increasingly more favorable to market pene-\\ntration, the project will attempt to enter market areas of high-cost energy\\nfirst and to enter large markets with corresponding lower energy costs\\nlater.\\nFigure 3 displays this overall market strategy. Economic value and\\nenergy cost in Figure 3 are represented in terms of life cycle levelized\\nenergy cost expressed in mills/kWh. Studies conducted by JPL indicate that\\nthere already exists a small near-term relatively high-cost energy market\\n(Ref. 1). This market is known as the isolated load market, where the user\\nis isolated from the grid. The local utility plant consists of litt 4.. more\\nthan a few diesel generators and a small transmission and distribution net-\\nwork. This application is typical of small communities on U.S. islands in\\nthe Pacific and Caribbean, remote military installations, and villages in\\ndeveloping countries. For the isolated load market, the estimates of\\nlevelized bus bar energy costs range from 150 to 200 mills/kWh in the\\n1990-2000 time frame.\\nII-8\\n250 — — ---T—\\nO\\t ISOLATED\\n} 200 \\t • THERMAL AND/OR ELECTRIC r\\n2 • OILFIRED\\nZ H\\t • NOT CONNECTED TO GRID\\n`L co 1501C^W\\nN \"\\t INDUSTRIALJ t\\nj Y 100- \\t • THERMAL AND/OR ELECTRIC\\nw_J\\n^ E\\t CONUS UTILITY\\n} 50\\n• U.S. MAINLANDy\\nU\\t• GRID CONNECTED\\n1\\t 10\\t 100\\t 1000\\t10,000\\nMARKET SIZE (MW/yr)\\n10\\t 100\\t 1000 \\t 10,000 \\t 100,000\\nNo. OF 20 kW UNITS/YEAR AT 20% MARKET PENETRATION\\nFigure 3. Energy Cost and Market Size\\nII-9\\nConversations with representatives of utilities located on Pacific\\nislands reveal that fuel costs early in 1979 were $18.50 per barrel and\\ndiesel generator installed costs were $600/kW(e) resulting in 1979 level-\\nized bus bar costs 120 mills/kWh.1/ Clearly the remote utility application\\nis a significant early market for dish collector electric power plants. A,.\\nshown in Figure 3, the projected size of this market in the 1990-2000 time\\nperiod is 300 to 1000 MW/year. Although this market is small in comparison\\nto the grid connected utility market, the graph also indicates that by\\nassuming only a 20% market penetration, up to 10,000 power modules per ye4r\\nwould be required to meet this need. Such a high production level would\\nclearly justify the use of mass production manufacturing techniques.\\nIn the long run, the major electrical market is the U.S. grid-con-\\nnected utility market which is referred to in Figure  3 as the CONUS (con-\\ntinental United States) utility market. Each power plant in the grid is\\nbacked-up by the balance of the utility\\'s generation and transmission\\ncapability. in 1974 the Southwestern U.S. utilities\\' generating capacity\\nwas about 46,000 MWe. Almost all utilities in the continental U.S. are\\ngrid-connected, or will be by the 1980\\'s. Using conservati:* estimates of\\navailability and prices of conventional fuels, it is projected in Ref. 2\\nthat levelized bus bar energy costs (BBEC) for new plants operational in\\nthe 1990 time period will range from 50 to 70 mills/kWh for base •.)i\\ncoal-steam plants, and up to 200 mills/kWh for it-fired intermediate and\\npeaking plants.\\nIn addition to the electric market, both grid and non-grid connected,\\nthere exists a large market for a combination of both thermal and electric\\npower. Industrial process heat is a typical application in this category.\\nEventual penetration of this market should Expand the use of the parabolic\\ndish system significantly.\\nIn summary, it is clear that to build manufacturing volume most expe-\\nditiously, the high cost, isolated load markets should be penetrated first.\\n1.\\tBased on a capacity factor of 0.6, system life of 30 years, a fuel\\nescalation rate of 3% above inflation, and an annualized fixed charge rate\\nof 0.157.\\n111-10\\nTo compete in the low cost grid-connected market will require both experi-\\nence and production volume which can result from the successful prior\\npursuit of the higher cost, isolated markets.\\n4.\\tConcept of First and Second Generation Technology\\nFrom a technology standpoint, the project strategy is to first\\ndevelop hardware suitable for entering the near-term isolated load market.\\nFirst generation equipment, based on gas turbine technology, will entail\\nless development risks and permit the early introduction of solar plants\\ninto the marketplace. Satisfying the demands of the near-term market will\\nhelp to mature all the infrastructures essential to solar power plant\\nsales, especially with regard to collectors. Just as importantly, this\\nstrategy ,will also make solar power plant technology more visible and thus\\nencourage its la %.-scale use in other applications.\\nTo meet the long-term goal of the project (i.e., entering the grid-\\nconnected market with baseload coal-steam and nuclear plants), improved\\nsystem efficiency is needed. This will be achieved through use of advanced\\nengine (second generation) technology. Additional cost reductions are\\nexpected from continuing improvements in dish collector design,, and through\\nincreased production.\\nSolar• power plants produced from first generation technology have\\nsystem goals of 100 to 120 mills/kW hr-. Such plants can compete with con-\\nventional systems in the near term isolated  l oad market, and in the oil-\\nfired, intermediate-peaking, grid-connected market, but will need to be\\nimproved for the baseload grid-connected power plant market. The main\\nattraction of these plants is that they will enter the near term market,\\ndevelop the required infrastructure and require only a modest R&D invest-\\nment by the government to mature.\\nPower plants using second generation dish technology wi ll require more\\ntime to bring on line (3 to 4 years of additional technology development)\\nand consequently will require more resources to develop. Work on second\\ngeneration systems has already begun. These plants have system cost goals\\n(^\\'€^) of 50 to 60 mills/kWh, which are clearly competitive with coal and\\nnuclear systems in the grid-connected market. Utilizing the above costs\\nfor electricity, cost targets have been developed for both first and second\\ngeneration subsystems hardware. These are shown in Table 2.\\n5.Component Cost Projections\\nSome progress has already been made in studying the attainability of\\nthe cost n)als presented above. Preliminary studies have bean completed on\\nthe two major subsystems of the power plant, i.e., the dish concentrator\\nand the power conversion unit. Concentrator costs are important due to\\ntheir dominance in power plant costs, and due to their amenability to the\\nmass-production process. Studies are under way both at JPL and by industry\\nto assess the effect of mass production in reducing dish concentrator\\ncosts. Manufacturing techniques and tooling requirements are being studied\\nto develop a basis for estimating capital equipment costs and the produc-\\ntion costs of dish concentrators. As in example of this work, estimates of\\nthe reduction in concentrator costs as the annual production rates increase\\nare shown in Figure 4. The estimates were made for JPL by four different\\nindustrial contractors. The encouraging result from these studies is that\\nthe first generation concentrator cost targets are easily met at production\\nrates as low as 10,000 units/year. These projections represent total\\ninstalled costs for the concentrator. Figure 5 displays the cost range of\\nthe four contractors for each of the major concentrator subsystems for a\\nproduction rate of 100,010 per year.\\nProduction studies have also been performed by industry for small\\nengines such as gas turbines, Rankine turbines, Stirling engines and indus-\\ntrial diesel plants. A composite of these results is presented in Figure\\n6.As may be seen, at 25,000 units/year engine/generatLr costs are about\\n160 $/kW.\\n6.\\tProjected Power Plant Bus Bar Energy Costs\\nEstimates of levelized bus bar energy costs from dish-electri\\nplants have been made based on projected component performance anc\\nThe results of these studies are presented in Figure 7 as a fun,-\\nII-12\\nTABLE 2.

Infor-\\nmation is presented in this fashion since power module cost is a strong\\nfunction of the collector and engine costs which are in turn affected by\\nthe production rate. Figure 7 also indicates the assumed costs for the\\nbasic module components (concentrator, receiver and engine) in various pro-\\nduction mates, and the assumed balance of plant and 0&M costs. At a pro-\\nduction rate of 25,000 units/year and assuming no energy storage, levelized\\nbus bar energy costs of 75 mills/kWeh are projected (1979 dollars). These\\nnumbers are based on what is believed to be a conservative estimate regard-\\ning engine-generator conversion efficiency (40%) for the 1990 time period.\\nWith a more optimistic estimate of efficiency (i.e., 45%), the bus bar cost\\ndecreases to about 67 mills/kWeh. At very large production rates (400,000\\nmodules/year), the costs decrease to 58 miils/kWeh. Clearly such costs\\npermit penetration of the grid-connected utility market.\\n7.\\tProject Strategy and Status\\ti\\nThe TPS project goal is to demonstrate technical, operational, and\\neconomic readiness of PFDR technology for electric and thermal power appli-\\ncations. To reach this goal in a timely manner, the project has three\\nparallel but complementary activities or elements as shown in Figure 8.\\nAdvanced Development is R&D oriented, with emphasis on feasibility testing\\nand component and materials development. Advanced designs from this activ-\\nity are utilized by the Technology Development element which does the\\ndetailed engineering and fabricates and validates (tests) a complete module\\n(concentrator, receiver and engine).\\nThe third element of the project, Applications Development, is respon-\\nsible for developing complete power plant system and demonstrating the\\ntechnology through a series of engineering experiments sited in a variety\\nof potential user environments. The status of each of these three project\\nelements is described below.\\nII-18\\nFea4:bi{ityi eatsTechnologyReadinessTestsSystemReadiness\\nTestsJPL\\nTHERMAL POWER\\nSYSTEMS PROJECT\\nADVANCED\\tTECHNOLOGY\\tAPPLICATIONS\\nDEVELOPMENT\\tDEVELOPMENT\\tDEVELOPMENT\\n.,\\nCOMPONENTS/\\tMODULES\\tSYSTEMS\\nSUBSYSTEMS\\nFigure 8. Interrelationships Between TPS Projzot Elements\\nII-19\\n7.1 Technology Development\\nThe present thrust of this project element (Ref. 3) is to develop\\nfirst generator subsystems (including concentrators, receivers/transport\\nand power converters) which can be utilized in the Applications Development\\nelement for engineering experiments. The major products of this project\\nelement are illustrated in Figure 9.\\nFirst generation hardware emphasizes proven gas turbine technology for\\nthe power conversion equipment, and an injection molding process for fabri-\\ncation of the plastic petals or gores for the dish concentrator structure.\\nThis manufacturing technique already exists and is used in the production\\nof a number of commercial products such as refrigerator doors. It should\\nfacilitate the attainment of mass-producible, low-cost contractors. A\\nfirst-generation dish concentrator being developed by General Electric and \\t Y\\nconfigured for injection molding is shown in Figure 10. Similarly, exist-\\ning small gas turbine technology, very much like that developed for auto-\\nmobile turbochargers, cruise missiles, torpedoes, and auxiliary power \\t \\'-\\nunits, is being studied for the eventual mass production of power conver-t,\\nsion subsystems. The first-generation engine and receiver, presently being\\ndeveloped by Garrett Corporation, is shown in Figure 11.;o\\nThe schedule of Figure 12 shows the flow of design, fabrication and\\ntest activities for both first- and second-generation hardware leading to\\ntwo key events: a Brayton module on test in mid CY 1981, and a Stirling\\nmodule on test early in CY 1984. The subsystems involved are concentra-\\ntors, receivers, and power convertors. Second generation subsystems will\\nbe selected for incorporation in the Technology Development element of the\\nproject on the basis of the status of competing concepts emerging from the\\nAdvanced Development work described below.\\nTesting and evaluation of these dish power modules are performed at\\nthe JPL desert test site shown in Figure 13. Evaluation of early dish\\nhardware is already taking place at this, ite. A 6-meter diameter dish\\nmodule purchased commercially from the Omnium-G Company of Anaheim,\\nCalifornia has been under evaluation at the test site since early 1979.

The Omnium-G module and t\\'e Test Bed\\nConcentrator are shown in Figure 14.\\nEarlier dish hardware developed under a Sandia-Albuquerque (SLA)\\nprogram is shown in Figure 15. One unit was developed for SLA by the\\nRaytheon Corporation, the other by General Electric. Both of these units\\nai•e limited to temperatures of about 600\\'F. The general Electric unit was\\ndesigned for use in a total energy application at Shenandoah, Georgia.\\n7.2 Advanced Development\\nThe work of this project elemcnt is directed tc the development of\\nmaterials and d ish subsystems which meet the cost and performance goals of\\nsecond and subsequent generation dish power plants. Example components are\\ncellular glass monolithic goris for concentrators; both heat pipe and\\nnon-heat pipe hybrid high-temperature receivers for both power conversion\\nand high temperature thermal applications; thermal transport and buffer\\nstorage; and under LeRG technical management, both free piston and kine-\\nmatic Stirling engines for power conversion. This advanced work is in\\ndirect support of the Technol f-igy Development effort described previously.\\nMost of the work is accomplished directly through subcontractors to\\nJPL and LeRC. The work falls in two categories, that done under DOE pro-\\ngram managemert and the remainder which is done under SERI program manage-\\nment as shown in Figure 16. Highlights of the work in progress are shown\\nin Figure 17.\\nAn important part of the Advanced Development effort is the develop-\\nment of second- generation point focusing components (Ref. 4). The main\\nthrust regarding engine concept is the Stirling eng ne although considera-\\ntion is also being given to high temperature Brayton engines (2000°F),\\nand/or combined-cycle engines (which combine Brayton and Rankine tech-\\nnologies). Work for JPL on a Stirling engine and receiver is underway in\\njoint effort between Fairchild Stratos and United Stirling of Swede.i (USS)\\nI:-(25\\nOMNIUM G CONCENTRATOR \\t JPL TEST BED CONCENTRATOR BY E SYSTEMS\\nIFigure 14.

This\\ntest will be followed by a similar demonstration with the GE/North American\\nPhillips 1-98 engine/receiver module about a year later.\\n7.3 Applications Development\\nThe third project element is concerned with market applications of\\ndish systems (Ref. 5). Implementation of engineering experiments in vari-\\nous user environments is the mt,;^: 3ctivity of the Applications work. It\\nhas the goal of demonstrating technical, operation, and economic readiness\\nof dish systems in both electric power and process heat applications. The\\nexperiments are identified in terms of market sector in Figure 18. Three\\nseries of experiments have been defined, each related to a different market\\nsector. These three series of experiments are described below. A schedule\\nfor the near-term experiments 0, these series is shown in Figure 19.\\nEE No. 1 is known as the \"Small Community Sclar Thermal-Power Experi-\\nment,\" and is one megawatt in size. As noted in Figure 18, it looks toward\\nthe grid-connected market of the continental united States. Because this\\nmarket is as important as it is difficult, work is under way through EE No.\\n1 to gain early experience in that highly competitive market. It is\\nscheduled to be on-line in early CY 1983. The systems contractor will\\nselect the power converter but the collector will be first-generation tech-\\nnology as developed by the Project.\\nEE No. 2 is known formally as the \"Isolated Application Experiment\\nSeries,\" and addresses island sites, rural electrification in foreign coun-\\ntries, and other applications remote from the grid. Plant sizes will be\\nabout 100 kilowatts (electrical). A joint effort is now under way with the\\nNavy Civil Engineering Laboratory on a co-funded basis.

EE No. 2a is the first of the series, and is scheduled to be\\noperational in late CY 1982.\\nThe EE No. 3 series, addressing the industrial market, will initially\\nbe implemented through a series of very small experiments (less than 20\\nKWe) for thermal, electric and combined (cogeneration) applications.2/\\nThese small experiments will be conducted using available hardware to the\\nmaximum extent possible. Because they are small they can be constructed\\nand installed in a very short time. Although not a direct product of the\\nJPL program, an example of such an experiment is the ongoing effort co-\\nfunded by DOE and the Southern New England Telephone Company for an indus-\\ntrial cogeneration application, using the Omnium-G power module. The\\nprimary function of this power unit is to produce electricity for a\\nswitching center, but excess power will be used for space heating and for\\nabsorption cooling. The unit is to be operational early in CY 1980. A\\nnumber of other units of this class are scheduled by JPL for operation in\\nCY 1981.\\nExperiments in all three series will follow an improved technology\\npath with each new experiment utilizing the then current state-of-the-art\\ndish-engine technology.\\nStudies supporting these experiments are being conducted in-house and\\nby contractors and include costing, market penetration, industrialization,\\nmass production, and systems design requirements as a function of applica-\\ntion. A requirements analysis being performed by Science Applications,\\nInc., a market penetration study by General Electric, and an industrializa-\\ntion study by Arthur D. Little are examples of currently contracted activi-\\nties. Site selection criteria studies and market definition studies are\\nrepresentative of in-house work.\\nFor EE No. 1 (the small community experiment) the site selection\\nprocess is under way, and for EE Nos. 2 & 3 the various sites are to be\\nselected during CY 1980. The site selection activities are the responsi-\\nbilities of DOE aithough JPL will assist in the process.\\n2.\\tAs of this writing, DOE has not yet officially approved initiation of\\nthis series for FY-80, and thus it may be delayed until FY-81.\\nII-34\\nIF\\nWhen the experiment sites are selected, the applications oriented work\\nwill become heavily involved with integration of the multiple interfaces\\nrepresented by the community, the local utility, and the systems contrac-\\ntor. This phase of the project will be its first operational phase and\\nwill provide direct indication of the extent to which dish technology is\\nmeeting its operational goals, and will reveal the extent of market pene-\\ntration that can be expected of subsequent second- generatiu,.t.echnology.\\n8.Acknowledgement\\nIn writing this paper, the authors have borrowed from the work of many\\nasolar thermal investigators at JPL and the NASA/Lewis Research Center.

L. :\\nQ.\\t\"Does the paper address the estimated 0 & M costs under given environ-\\nmental conditions?\"\\nA.\\t\"This topic is covered only very loosely.\"\\nQ.\\t\"Have relative 0 & M costs for the various technologies been estab-\\nlished?\"\\nA. \"More work has been done in this area during the past few months. We\\nare not sure if the Brayton engine will have lower 0 & M costs than\\nthe Stirling although the Brayton probably has a much longer life\\nspan. Much attention is being paid to this subject. The 0 & M costs\\noverall are very similar. Although the Stirling engine may have\\nmaintenance costs as much as three times the estimate for a Brayton,\\nthe higher efficiencies associated with the Stirling engine show it\\nmay be superior to the Brayton in terms of second generation techno-\\nlogy.\\nQ. \"What considerations have been made for the maintenance of components\\nsuch as reflectors, etc., that are independent of the generator\\nsystem?\"\\nA. \"Fortunately, much of this work is being done through other programs\\nsponsored by DOE. For example, our 0 & M requirements for clean\\nmirrors will parallel those associated with heliostats and the large\\npower program DOE has. The-efore, we will tap off those programs to\\nthe maximum extent possible. We will take care of any additional\\npeculiar things which we think require specific attention. We do feel\\nthat the government has a pretty good handle on these costs already.\\nOne thing they are finding out is there can be too much cleaning..\\nPRECEDING PAGE BLA INIK NOT\\nII-37\\nSandia, Albuquerque has done a considerable amount of work in defining\\nthe optimum cleaning process.\"\\nQ.\\t\"At what frequency are these systems operational?\"\\nA.\\t\"They can be designed for any frequency, but 60 Hz will probably be\\nour standard.\"\\nQ.\\t\"How does one regulate phase, etc., in order to put these systems on a\\ngrid?\"\\nA. \"An integral part of the power plant will be the power conditioning\\nand regulating system. System selection will depend on application\\nspecific factors which are a lot more technical than I am prepared to\\nanswer at this time.\"\\nQ.\\t\"What is the working fluid in this Stirling engine?\"\\nA. \"This is a closed cycle system so helium is the working medium. For\\nthe Brayton, the working medium is air. Additionally, we are looking\\nat more advanced closed loop Brayton systems that use helium-argon\\nmixture, These systems have the potential to be more efficient and\\ncompact.\"\\nQ. \"The integration of these systems with alternate fuels has been men-\\nti oned. Does this mean that these fuels will be used with the Stir-\\nling and Brayton engines or with more conventional auxillary engines?\"\\nA.\\t\"The fuel will be used with the Stirling and Brayton engines. This is\\npossible since the gas or oil burners are an integral part of either\\nthe receiver or the engine. \\tIn the case of the Brayton turbine\\nsystem, the burner system is already in place and we are simply\\n•7\\nII-38\\nattaching the thermal receiver. When solar radiation is not avail\\nable, the turbine is fired by gas or oil combustion. In the case of\\nthe Stirling Engine, the alternate fuel is utilized through combustion\\nwithin the receiver itself.\"\\n1\\nQ. \"It was mentioned that another conference which would emphasize remote\\nsmall dish industrial applications would be held in the near future.\\nWhat is the tentative date for this?\"\\nA.\\t\"It would probably be held in October or November of 1980.\"\\nQ.\\t\"If there is to be an industrial program by next year, what is being\\naccomplished in the area of heat sinks (thermal storage)?\"\\nA. \"The incorporation of thermal storage systems was not covered in this\\npaper. For process heat, the systems would be entirely different.\\nHeat engines would not be placed at the focal point. Rather, the\\ncollective system would consist of networks of transmission lines from\\ndish to dish that transport the thermal energy to a central storage\\nposition. The government is supporting the development of thermal\\nstorage systems.\"\\nQ.\\t\"What branch of the government is supporting research in thermal\\nstorage?\"\\nA. \"The branch is called STOR. 5TOR deals with many proyrams which\\ninvolve the storage of heat, including solar and geothermal applica-\\ntions.\"\\ni\\ni\\t\\nII-39\\nGUEST SPEAKERS\\nDOD ENERGY MANAGEMENT\\nGeorge Marienthal\\nDeputy Assistant Secretary of Defense\\n.\\t (Energy, Environment & Safety)\\nr\\nI.\\tINTRODUCTION\\nIt\\'s a real pleasure to be here this morning and help you kick off\\nyour workshop for potential military and civilian users of small solar\\nthermal electric power technologies.\\nThis workshop is a real mileston=. It is the first workshop that DOE\\nhas helped sponsor which has looked to the Department of Defense early in a\\ntechnology development phase so that our application requirements could\\ninfluence systems design. We appreciate it.\\nThis type of cooperative effort between DOD and the Department of\\nEnergy has and will produce significant benefits for each of our organi-\\nzations. We recognize that technology efforts are denoted to specific\\napplications. DOE\\'s R&D is often more general, but we can help give some\\nfocus to DOE\\'s programs and provide a testbed for demonstration of energy\\ntechnology applications.\\nWe encoarrage working level cooperation between our laboratories and\\nthe national laboratories. They will benefit our own missions and will\\ncontribute significantly to the realization of the President\\'s energy\\ngoals.\\nI am especially pleased to speak to all of you, because we are very\\nmuch interested in small scale energy systems which will promote energy\\nindependence and reduce our reliance on local utility systems.\\nAs you all know, we have established a military standard family of\\nmobile electric power , generators to satisfy many of our specific require-\\nments for remote power needs.\\nMERADCOM is our program manager for this effort and has done a splen-\\ndid jot over the last five years in this capacity.\\nIII-1\\n6\\nStandardization of military mobile electric power generators is indeed\\nin the best interest of availability, interchangeability of parts, main-\\ntainability, and reduced logistic support.\\nEven with our emphasis on standardization, we believe that the appli-\\ncation of new energy technologies will help to satisfy our enormous\\nappetite for energy--especially for our remote and portability needs.\\nEnergy technology demonstration is important to the Department of\\nDefense and to the nation\\'s energy program as well. I will describe our\\nenergy technology demonstration effort in a little greater depth in a few\\nminutes.\\nTo discuss energy in the context of my responsibilities for energy,\\nerti,ironment, and safety, I\\'ll answer your question before you ask it.\\nManagement of energy, environment, and safety is quite compatible. Their\\nprograms, while mutually exclusive, often lend support to one another.\\nII. OVERVIEW\\nOur energy program is aggressive and well balanced. My following\\nremarks will give you an overview of:\\n(1)How defense energy resources are managed at the 000 policy level;\\n(2)How we are organized and how our management structure is inte-\\ngrated with the military departments;\\n(3)How our energy program dovetails with Department of Energy prc-\\ngrams ;\\n(4)What our goals and objectives are;\\n(5)What our programs are to achieve them; and\\n(6)What our long-range plans are to assure a continued energy supply\\nunder all circumstances.\\nIII. OCD ENERGY MANAGEMENT\\nOur energy organization is decentra\\'iized, but it is functionally\\nstructured to handle energy contingencies, develop energy policy, and\\ndesign long-range energy plans and programs.\\nIII-2\\nWhile my office serves as the focal point for all DOD energy matters,\\nspecific energy program managers include:\\n(1)DLA/DFSC for bulk POL procurement,\\n(2)DASD (I&H) for military construction & ECIP,\\n(3)DUSOR&E (R&AT) for energy research and development, and\\n(4)DUSDR&E (AP) for GOCO conservation programs.\\nDOD energy policy is coordinated through the DEPC senior level policy\\ncouncil comprised of:\\ni\\t\\n(1) OSD principals,\\n(2)Military departments (Spec. Ass\\'ts. for Energy.)\\n(3)JCS (Director, J-4)\\n(4)DLA/DFSC (Director, DLA and Comaander, DFSC).\\nWe have assigned lead service responsibilities to the military depart-\\nments for key energy technologies to:\\n(1)Enhance energy management,\\n(2)Ensure better coordination, and\\n(3)Provide a means for technology transfer.\\nI will cover this lead service concept a little more in depth later.\\nIV. SCOPE OF DOD ENERGY PROGRAM\\nWhile we use tremendous amounts of energy--80 percent of all federal\\nconsumption--we rely heavily on petroleum. Petroleum accounts for nearly\\n70 percent of defense energy consumption. Last year, we used 252 billion\\nbarrels of oil equivalent. 170 million barrels were petroleum. The Air\\nForce was the biggest user at 57 percent. Navy and Marine Corps used 33\\npercent, and-Army used 10 percent.\\nOperationally, our energy usage looks like this:\\n0\\t Aircraft operations is our biggest--last year\\'s use was 113\\nmillion barrels alone.\\nOur energy is expensive. Last year we paid more than four billion\\ndollars for it, and we estimate that it will cost nearly six billion in\\n1985. This estimate may be quite conservative, however.\\nIII-3\\nDOD\\'s consumption since 1973 has decreased 30 percent while the costs\\nhave continitelly increased. Last year DOD reduced energy consumption nine\\npercent under FY 1975, the baseline year for measuring energy conservation\\nin the federal government.\\n(1)12 percent mobile operations, and\\n(2)4 percent in facilities.\\nV.\\tMANAGEMENT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES\\nWe have divided our goals and objectives into two groups:\\n(1)Supply, and\\n(2)Conservation.\\nOur supply and conservation goals cover both installations and mobil-\\nity operations. These are our installation energy supply goals. They\\ncover the use of more plentiful energy resources and alternate fuel cap-\\nabilities for our facilities.\\nOur mobility goals are designed to:\\n(1)Minimize supply disruptions and,\\n(2)Achieve capability to use a greater range of fuels.\\nOur installation energy conservation goal is to achieve a 20 percent\\nenergy reduction in our existing buildings by 1985. We plan to do this\\nwith:\\n(1)ECIP ($1.5 billion retrofit program), and\\n(2)Other efforts (ECMS, energy awareness, etc.).\\nFor mobility operations, we will limit our operational energy use to\\nwhat we used in 1975.

This keeps any one branch from closing its doors and operating\\nin a vacuum.\"\\nQ.\\t\"Does \\'the outside\\' have access to these points of contact within the\\nservices?\"\\nA.\\t\"Absolutely. The energy program should operate \\'in the sunshine\\'.\"\\nQ. \"The on-site base locations mentioned are within the United States.\\nSeeing that there are considerable foreign bases of the same size and\\nnature, are there any comparable projects for these installations?\"\\nA. \"There are things being done overseas, but obviously not to the same\\nextent rF: here in the States. This  i s due to the fact that here we\\nare dealing with the importation of petroleum from foreign sources.\\nHopefully, these programs will help reduce this dependence. Hence,\\ndomestic projects have priority.\"\\nQ.\\t\"Concerning fuel replacement in particular, could petroleum dependence\\nin areas like Diego Garcia be reduced or ended?\"\\nA.\\t\"Conversion possibilities are being explored in these types of areas\\nsince they are dependent on many different types of fuel.\"r_ T_\\nIII-23\\nQ.\\t\"It was mentioned that the Army is involved in solar heating and\\ncooling. Is there a point of contact for inquires?\"\\nA.\\t\"Yes. Don Faehn is the point of contact at Fort Belvoir for photo-\\nvoltaics.\"\\nQ. \"During the course of this workshop we will be looking at potential\\nmilitary applications for this technology in several different ver-\\nsions. In particular, we will be examining potential mobile or port-\\nable applications, isolated applications, and facilities applications.\\nIf it is determined that indeed there are feasible mission related\\nmilitary applications for this technology, given that there is not now\\na lead service or energy technology demonstration project, what would\\nbe the proper routes to take to turn these understandings into action\\nprograms?\"\\nA. \"This quest would involve a normal marketing problem to the military\\nwhich is a tough endeavor. There is no well-defined nor straight-\\nforward method that can be recited to get the job done. Generally,\\none must have good support from users of the technology, must get\\ninside the military lab structures and R&0 programs, and must find\\nsupport from within the Pentagon.\"\\nQ. \"Then can it be assumed that since we have representatives from the\\nlaboratories, from the users, from the manufacturers, and from the\\ncivil sector as well, that this, a first step to setting the clockwork\\nin motion, and that positive action will need the continued support\\nand effort of all those involved?\"\\nA.\\t\"Quite certainly.\"\\nIII-24\\ni\\nIa\\n1\\ni\\nQ. \"As is known, one of the goals of this conference is to implement this\\nsort of thing (methods of marketing to military). A year and a half\\nago your office took a very strong position in this line to forward\\nthis specific technology of solar thermal electric power in a pamphlet\\nwhich was sent to 000 R&E. This was met with rather apparent apathy.\\nHas the atmosphere changed any since this time, or is there a better\\nresponsiveness now? What happens from below obviously is a reaction\\nof the interest from above. How can implementation take place if the\\nleaders of the R&D community will not come forward?\"\\nA. \"In all honesty, things are ; . Netter now. Military R&D managers are\\ncurrently interested in the F-18, the MX\\'s, etc., as is desired. On\\nthe other hand, it is tough to get less than top persons interested in\\nthe sort of things we are pushing. We are trying; unfortunately the\\nsituation is not inspiring.\"\\nQ.\\t\"What are the base locations of Showcase?\"\\nI\\nA.\\t\"The Red River Army Depot is the Army Showcase base location. The\\nNavy\\'s Showcase is at Norfolk, VA, and the Air Force has their show-\\tI\\ncase at the McClellan base, Sacramento, CA. These bases, especiallyA\\nNorfolk and Sacramento, have high military and civil visibility which\\nshould greatly enhance the programs.\"\\nQ. \"Persons who represent industry are hearing quite inspiring and im-\\npressive goals from DOD and DOE; however, it is quite difficult to see\\nany affirmative action towards meeting those stated goals. It is also\\ndifficult to understand the rationale used for selecting photovoltaics\\nand geothermal technology over others such as solar thermal. Here we\\nare talking about Brayton technology, yet the Army is probably the\\nonly manufacturer of Brayton engines, and their program has little in\\ncommon with what we are trying to do here. Hence, as a representative\\nof industry, I would like to encourage the tying together of, and more\\nIII-25\\nspecific action toward the ideas, goals, and technologies because they\\nare worthy of merit. Finally, as a stated question, what is the\\nspecific role and impact of DOD R&E in this?\"\\nA. \"In iteration of my earlier response to this question, DOD R&E is\\ninvolved, yet not to the degree desirable. Although they are respon-\\nsible, they have not measured up to this reponsibility. In response\\nto the question concerning action, I have that responsibility by de-\\nfault. I am, therefore, pushing this effort which otherwise would not\\nget pushed. Within the Department of Defense, the program is tied\\ntogether quite clearly with its structure, goals, and directions well\\nmapped into 1985. I extend appologies for not being able to display\\nthis in a more explicit manner. The input of these goals on other\\nsegments of society, including industry, is unclear. DOD makes its\\nown goals at the direction of the Commander-in-Chief. Whether or not\\nwe are to provide leadership to industry, I don\\'t know. 000 and DOE\\nspent a year agonizing over various technologies to concentrate on.\\nWe concentrated on those technologies which were between now and \\'way\\ndown the road,\\' and which could be implemented in some of our 400 odd\\ncities. From this process, geothermal and solar electric technologies\\nemerged.\"\\nQ. \"Given the annual budget considerations that the Department of Defense\\nhas to work with, do the higher front end costs associated with solar\\ntechnology inhibit lower level personnel from proposing solar proj-\\nects? Likewise, do these same costs keep higher level personnel from\\ngoing to Congress with what appear to be inflated budget reports?\"\\nA. \"In both cases, this is correct. The life cycle cost effectiveness\\nfigureb associated with solar technology inhibit interest when money\\nis scarce.\"\\nIII-26\\nb\\t\\n\\'\\nComment \"It appears that a portable fuel source is what is needed and\\nthat other topics are peripheral. Your program seems to lack an\\n\\' aggressive effort with synthetic fuels. Perhaps the high temp-\\nerature point focusing solar technology could add a new dimension\\nto the production of synthetic fuels. One would think that the\\nDefense Department is uniquely capable of such an endeavor.\"\\nQ. \"During the presentation, one slide displayed that 39 percent of the\\ntotal energy DOD uses goes to facilities. Systems that are being\\ndiscussed here are capable of displacing a large fraction of that 39\\npercent. Conceptually, if X amount of fuel is displaced from facility\\noperations, that X amount can be used to help offset fuel demands for\\naircraft and logistical operations. Is the same true in actual prac-\\ntice? If indeed the technologies being considered here can offset\\nDOD\\'s petroleum use by 10, 20, or 30 percent, is this impact to those\\nconcerned enough to cause active support of such technology, or is\\nthis simply too abstract?\"\\nA. \"Certainly the ideas are correct; however, petroleum represents only\\n11 percent of the total energy figure. If indeed petroleum use could\\nbe reduced at facilities, mobile operations could receive the dis-\\nplaced allotment.\"\\nQ.\\t\"Cooperation has been encouraged between DOD labs and other national\\nlabs. Have roles been defined for DOD vis-a-vis other national labs?\"\\nA.\\t\"No. These roles have not been defined satisfactorily.\"\\nQ.\\t\"Will you be taking over management of the shale oil program, or will\\nthat be conducted by RMV\\nIII-27\\nA. \"Hopefully that will be handled by Research and Engineering. The\\nDepartment of Energy will be responsible for the management of pro-\\nduction and refinement of shale. Then the Department of Defense will\\nbe responsible for the specifications on the fuel.\"\\nIII-28\\nSMALL RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS AND THE PURSUIT OF INDEPENDENCE\\nMartin R. Adams\\nDeputy Program Director\\nfor Solar, Geothermal, Electric\\nand Storage Systems\\nDepartment o-` Energy\\nMr. Marienthal, Mr. Chairman, workshop participants.. -I am particu-\\nlarlyrleased to be here this morning, for I have been convinced for some\\ntime that we must, as a nation, place a great deal of emphasis on SMALL,\\nmarketable, renewable energy systems if we are to retain our accustomed\\nindependence at the family, community and small industrial levels -- and I\\nfeel that you will also conclude in this workshop that such systems have a\\nvital role to play in many military applications.\\nPerhaps you have heard of the ancient Chinese curse, \"May you live in\\ninteresting times.\" For those of us in the energy business, 1979 has not\\nbeen boring. Public interest and concern over the national energy picture\\n\\' is at its highest level since the 1973 embargo. Over the past five to six\\nyears we\\'ve had almost a continual shortfall in one fuel or another -- bift\\nthe gasoline shortage this summer really hit us where it hurts; in our\\npersonal independence. For the first time, we as individuals, have more\\ndirectly felt the energy constraints that some businesses and communities\\nhave encountered earlier, and have had to stop and plan real changes in our\\nlives. Sometimes it was relatively insignificant, like planning the family\\nschedule around whose car is odd or even, or taking a bus to work. On the\\nother hand, a family which was considering buying a house fifty miles from\\ntheir place of work may have had to resort to second thoughts. At the\\nmoment we have pA?nty of gasoline, but we know that it will never be 40\\ncents a gallon again.\\nIII-29\\nWhen this country was founded we were promised life, liberty and tie\\npursuit of happiness. Somehow we\\'ve come to equate these values with the\\nright to cheap, abundant energy from depletable fuels. We tend to forget\\nthat many of our forebearers ran their lives on whatever the individual\\nfamily or small community was able to gather in and that most of their fuel\\nsources were renewable. Until the coming of a nationwide rail network made\\nit possible to distribute coal to every home, the colonial family and the\\nWestern homesteader lived pretty much the same. Homes were heated with\\nwood fires. Land transportation and agriculture ran on horses, mules,\\noxen, and people. Wind moved boats on river and ijcean. Lighting came from\\nbear fat or whale oil or beeswax or sheep tallow. Water power ground wheat\\ninto flour and spun wool and cotton into yarn for clothes. When we went to\\nwar, we used horses and mules to haul artillery and wind and galley slaves\\nat sea. This first age of \"Small Renewable Energy Systems\" lasted\\nremarkably long time and never died out in the more remote parts of the\\nUnited States. Henry Ford was a long-time advocate of alcohol from farm\\ncrops as a motor fuel, reasoning that this would take up the slack in wheat\\nproduction as horses were ph2sed out. West Virginia coal was shipped to\\nWashington on mule barges via the C&0 Canal until 1924. Windmills supplied\\nelectric power and irrigation pumping on farms until the 30\\'s, when they\\nwere replaced by rural electrification programs. Boise, Idaho, began\\nheating homes with geothermal energy in the 1890\\'s; this system is still\\nfunctioning, although many homes went \"modern\" with natural gas later on.\\nSolar hot water heaters were popular in Florida before cheap depletable\\nfuels came along.\\nPerhaps by coincidence, the discovery of large quantities of oil and\\ngas in this country occurred during the heyday of the yiant trusts. A\\nconsumption economy made a lot of sense at the time -- the consumer enjoyed\\na warmer home and the ability to get around fast, and the industries pro-\\nfited. During this period the United States was transformed into a world\\npower, partly on the oasis of our large domestic energy resources and\\ncomplex distribution systems. We rationed gasoline during the Second World\\nWar, but we didn\\'t have to fight out the consequences of an embargo to win\\nI:I-30\\nthe war. Even as we started importing cheap Middle Eastern crude to take\\ncare of more and more of our needs, we became smug about our energy future.\\nThe Sherman Anti-Trust Act and the progressive income tax diminished the\\npower of individual energy resource companies, but the age of conspicuous\\nconsumption went on and on.\\niMeanwhile, individual Americans became accustomed to energy that was\\nnot only cheap but convenient. No need to go out and feed and water and\\ncurry Old Paint every morning -- just drive him around the corner and fill\\nhim up every couple of days. Chopping wood is something you do to add a\\nlittle atmosphere to the parlour. A flick of the switch turns night into\\nday and winter into summer and summer into winter. Don\\'t waste valuable\\npersonal energy on striking matches, brushing teeth, or opening cans: an\\nelectric appliance for every task. Even now, the most popular wedding\\npresent in D.C. is a machine that performs a dozen tasks that used to be\\ndone with a paring knife or a hand-operated egg beater. Need to get away\\nfrom it all? If you don\\'t have a camper, you can still load up the family\\ncar or hop on a plane and head for the beach or the hills.\\nThe price we\\'ve paid for all this convenience is the loss of our\\nindependence, of control over our lives. Indeed, we are dependent upon\\naccess to the oil resources of the Middle East, a politically volatile\\nregion in the shadow of the Soviet Union. The military implications of our\\nvulnerability are becoming more clear daily. The possibility of Soviet\\ncor.trol of the Middle East oil tap can no longer be ignored.\\nThis presents a particularly difficult energy problem to our military.\\nTo be a deterrent, we must be prepared to defend the Middle East and Per-\\nsian Gulf and the sea lanes without having access to fuels from these\\nareas. Energy independence of our military fo-ces is now a requirement if\\nthey are to be a deterrent. In addition, because of the quantity of energy\\nresources used by the military, conversion to alternate fuel sources, A\\npossible, becomes an important factor in meeting the nation\\'s energy\\nMarcy such opportunities lie in the SMALL solar applications category.\\nIII-31\\nI understand that the Department of Defense will convert 19 percent of\\ntheir energy needs to more abundant solid fuels by 1985 and 1 percent to\\nsolar or renewable sources.\\nThese are important goals, for the goal for solar (and other rentw-\\nables) amount to 5OMW in 1985.\\nThe Department of Energy is assisting industry in developing large\\ncentral energy conversion systems in solar thermal, photovoltaics, ocean\\nthermal aiid Geothermal areas. These involve electric power production\\nsystems up to 100 megawatts and more. They are alsc targeted for large\\nprocess heat and large fuels and chemical production. In their respective\\nareas of application, they all have national importance.\\nBut the renewable energy activities that are exciting ^o me are the\\nsmall, individually operated, system applications. Among others, we now\\nhave a solar thermal system pumping irrigation water in New M pxico; a small\\nphotovoltaic system providing electric power to an Indiar. village in\\nSchucholi, Arizona, and a 200 KW wind turbine in operation at Culebra,\\nPuerto Rico.\\nIn keeping with this, this workshop is devoted to solar thermal alec-\\ntric power applications ranging from a few megawatts down to 15 kilowatts\\nin size. More particularly, it involves parabolic dish (or point focusing)\\ntechnology, one of our most promising concepts for small community, small\\nindustrial and military applications. The importance of this technology\\nstems from its high potential effii-iency, and from its characteristic\\nmodularity. These characteristics make it a \"high performer\", one that is\\neasily mass produced and that has a minimum in field installation costs.\\nJPL is technically managing this program for DOE and is doing a fine job.\\nMost of you are also aware of the cooperative DOE/DOD activity in\\ndeveloping a 100 KW experiment for the U.S. Navy Civil Engineering Labora-\\ntory that JPL is also managing as part of our solar thermal applications\\nactivity. It is an exciting project and is an important step in the dish\\ntechnology program. But you will hear more about this during the workshop.\\nFor now I\\'d like to sum up. I am convinced that we must place a great\\ndeal of emphasis on SMALL renewable energy systems if we are to retain our\\nIII-32\\n6\\nindependence as individuals, and on a community and small industrial basis.\\nAs a Nation, we have the resources to do this job -- and are well underway.\\nThis workshop is an integral step in this process and I wish you much\\nsuccess in meeting your objective over the next few days.\\nIII-33M\\ne_ .\\nThe following questions were directed to and answered by Mr. Martin Adams,\\nDOE:\\nQ.\\t\"Is DOE prepared to take on OMB concerning the discount rate?\"\\nA.\\t\\n\\t\"DOE is prepared; however, I would not hazard a guess over the out-\\ncome.\"\\nQ. \"Assuming that these systems can achieve a cost of $5.00 per million\\nBTU, a problem stil l -xists because of the tax gradient between a\\ncapital item and an expense of fuel. The National Energy Act\\nattempted to warp that a bit and the IRS took exception. Is anything\\nbeing done to put a damper on this burden and increase the incentive?\"\\nA. \"We have had analysts review several incentive packages in light of\\nthis problem. The results were recorded in several papers which I\\ncould furnish. One paper had the surprising results that if the\\nprovisions offered in the NEA were 20% (ITC), then the depletable and\\nnondenietable technologies were about at a parity. Note that this was\\nonly one analyst who came to this conclusion. However, DOE will\\ncontinue to have incentives improved due to the high capital inten-\\nsity.\"\\nQ.\\t\"Is there a directory which contains the breakdown of persons within\\nDOE who are working on various projects and if so, is it available for\\ndistribution so that these persons may be contacted?\"\\nA.\\t\\n\\t\"Yes. It can be obtained by requesting the Gold Book which is pub-\\nlicly available.\"\\nPRECEDING PAGE\\nBLANK NOT FI \\t `^MED\\nIII-35\\nQ. \"Again representing the manufacturing sector, I would like to add that\\nfrom a preliminary standpoint it appears that two to three times the\\ncurrent budget aRount will be needed to even begin to accomplish your\\nstated goals.

These five year plans just are not viable.\"\\nA.\\t\"Your comments and concern are appreciated. We are concerned also.\"\\nQ.\\t\"The Department of Energy is often using the Federal Grant and Coop-\\nerative Agreement Act of 1977 on a variety of programs where it is\\nintended that the ultimate industry supposedly will benefit.

Do you anticipate using this Act for\\nthe type of technology discussed here?\"\\nA. \"As of now we have not developed our strategy of the program for small\\nscale systems.

Scott Hauger\\nProgram Manager, Military Energy Programs\\nThe BDM Corporation\\nIn conjunction with the workshop, The BOM Corporation conducted a\\nstudy for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to define plant requirements,\\nmarkets, and cost goals for military applications for point focusing solar\\nthermal electric technologies. This study served as EOM\\'s integrative\\npresentatior at the workshop.\\nThe BDM study determined that the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine\\nCorps currently maintain an inventory of approximately 1800 MW with an\\nannual procurement potential of 140 MW for power systems 15 KW and larger._\\nThe plant requirements of all these systems can potentially be met by\\nadvanced heat engines of the types under development for PFDR application.\\nSolar provided heat is consistent with approximately 33 MW annual pro-\\ncurement. An additional 30 MW per year could be used if DOD seeks self\\nsufficiency of mission critical facilities.\\nTotal military power purchased from utilities is the equivalent of\\napproximately 5000 MW generating capacity. If Congress were to authorize\\nthe capital expense for total base self-sufficiency, an additional 220 MW\\nannual market would result. Cogenerating systems would increase the\\ndemand. Current service goals may be presented by the Air Force, which has\\nthe objective of meeting 25 percent of facilities power by renewable\\nresources and 25 percent with alternate fuels in the year 2000.\\nCost goals vary with assumptions, but a baseline case assuming 8\\npercent fu-1 escalation indicates cost goals of 120-210 mills/KWh, depend-\\ning on size, for military generators and 86 mills/KWh for purchased elec-\\ntricity.

Scott Hauger,\\nBDM:\\nQ.\\t\"Do you have an estimate of what cost differential the military might\\nbe willing to pay for reliability and independence?\"\\nA. \"No, not in terms of dollars. However, one ke:r to marketing systems\\nto the military is the generation of requirements documents. There\\nare requirements documents that exist stating the benefits to the\\nmilitary without regard to technology. In terms of cost benefit\\nanalysis, I am not aware that they exist.\"\\nQ. \"Naturally, one constraint has been and is Congressional support. Do\\nyou have a feel for the extent of Congressional commitment for this\\ntechnology?\"\\nA. \"As an observation from the sidelines I can say that there are defi-\\nnitely persons in Congress that can have an impact on passing legisla-\\ntion for military applications of solar technology. It would appear\\nthat solar energy military technology would draw together some\\npolitical interests by intersecting the circles of environmentalists,\\nmilitary procurement specialists, and solar energy supporters that\\nexist in Congress. However, it would be futile to go further by\\npredicting personal attitudes of Congressional supporters.\"\\nQ. \"At the 10KW rating, a slide displayed that advanced Stirling and\\nBrayton engines were better than a diesel by a factor of 3. Why is\\nthe military not frantically developing Stirling and Brayton systems?\"\\nA. \"Firstly, these figures were simply cost projections based on life\\ncycle assumptions. Secondly in the 1960\\'s when fuel was plentiful and\\nthe goal was silent power, the military showed significant interest in\\nIV-29\\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\\nStirling engines. Now there are competing technologies such as gas\\nturbines, solar thermal, solar electric, fuel cells, diesels, as well\\nas Stirling and Brayton engines. Each is at a different point of\\nprogram development, hence many are not being considered competitive\\nbecause of a lesser degree of developmec,t.\"\\nQ.\\t\"Do you think that the combination technology of solar thermal adds to\\nthe aforementioned technology sufficiently to raise interest?\"\\nA.\\t\"There are persons here because they hold the opinion that it does.\\nThat is one reason for this workshop.\"\\nQ. \"To this point no mentio:r has been made concerning photovoltaic tech-\\nnology as being a competitor to point focusing thermal electric tech-\\nnology. It seems quite necessary to consider this alternative for the\\nproposed military and industrial markets and to compare the relative\\nmerits of the two technologies. Shouldn\\'t this be closely considered\\nwhen identifying markets and applications?\"\\nA. \"Certainly this should be considered. Yet there are certain dif-\\nferences that are inherent to the marketing of these systems. The\\nuniqueness of the point focusing system is that it is hybrid and fuel\\nbecomes the medium for storage. Photovoltaics have quite different\\nrequirements for electrical energy storage. Thus, the two cannot be\\ncompared solely by cost analysis. Their operational effectiveness\\nbecomes a critical comparison factor. A personal opinion is that\\nphotovoltaics are much better suited for applications less than 1KW\\nthan are solar thermal units. Larger applications are more difficult\\nto compare and assess. However, for portable applications, photo-\\nvoltaics cannot compete due to their storage requirements. This may\\nalso hold true for remote applications due to the cogeneration cap-\\nability of solar thermal units.\\nIV-30\\nAdditional Comments\\n\"In the interest of persons desiring to create a market for solar\\ntechnology as well as those pe rsons involved in R&D, the simple necessity\\nto sell solar technology, whether it be solar electric, solar thermal,\\nshybrid, etc., should be emphasized. Once this is uone, the superior tech-\\nnology will emerge as a direct consequence. So perhaps efforts to pre-\\ndetermine the \\'best\\' would be wisely directed tow grds creating a market.\\nThe type of disagreement between solar thermal and solar electric is much\\nlike the nonsensical bickering between the Army and the Navy. Our purpose\\nshould be to make solar technology real.\"\\n\"Several things should be pointed out concerning the comparison of7\\nsolar thermal units and photovoltaics. A consulting firm has been con-\\ntracted to do this analysis and although the study is not yet complete,\\nseveral results should be noted. It was found that the biggest problem of\\nthe competing technologies is, figuratively speaking, in the ditch. Solar\\nthermal units often require a high degree of precision concerning concen-\\ntrating ratios in order to achieve their high efficiency ratings. This is\\n^ 1\\nnot true with photovoltaics. Yet even with the large tracking arrays\\nneeded for high efficiency solar thermal systems, they are still very\\ncompetitive with photovoltaics.\"\\n\"The other conclusion has been that small 5 or 6 meter less rigid\\ndishes combined with Stirling engines can be more economically feasible\\nthan photovoltaics in the 1KW to 7KW region.\"\\n\"It should be pointed out that the marketplace is so very complex that\\nthere is no way to possibly study all the different tradeoffs that must be\\nmade. Only the market environment will eventually show what technologies\\nwill penetrate. Hence, care should be taken at this point in assigning\\nspecific technologies to narrow markets. If one or the other technology is\\npushed too hard, the market will be distorted.\"\\nIV-31\\nSOLAR THERMAL ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS\\nIMPACT ANALYSIS AND REQUIREMENTS DEFINITION STUDY\\nDr. Yudi Gupta\\nScience Applications Inc.\\ns\\nSolar thermal electric power systems have the potential to supply\\ni power for industrial, commercial, institutional, and utility applications\\nand to reduce consumption of non renewable fossil fuels. SAI is currently\\nunder contract to JPL to analyze the impacts of solar thermal electric\\nsystems and to define_ requirements in terms of system cost, performance,\\nand design which are necessary for the development and utilization of solar\\nelectricity.\\nThe original scope of the study was to address applications for solar\\nthermal electric systems in the 1-10 MWe size range over the 1985-2000 time\\nframe. This scope is currently under review for modification; however, the\\nresults to date and the discussion here relate primarily to electric-only\\napplications in the 1-10 MWe range.\\nThe impacts analysis and requirements definition of solar thermal\\nelectric systems is an extremely complex analysis for even a single appli-\\ncation. Several key steps are involved. It is first necessary to evaluate\\nthe status of solar thermal electric technology, to identify promising\\napplications, and to characterize important site/region variables. In\\naddition, these interrelated tasks must be developed quantitatively in\\nterms of system cost/performance models, load models and characterization\\nof user energy and financial needs, and models on site/region characteris-\\ntics including hourly weather tapes. It is then possible to perform\\ndetailed impact assessments and identify key system requirements.\\nThe approach taken by SAI reflects each of the key steps. Because of\\nthe qualitative orientation of this workshop and the short time allotted,\\nthe emphasis here is on the general nature of the applications, the data\\nrequirements, and the key parameters which must be addressed for an effec-\\ntive solar thermal electric requirement definition.\\nPRECEDING PAUL: j^4n NUtIV-33 \\t\\nr.Ltrl^p\\nThe major subsystems of a solar thermal electric plant include:\\n(1)concentrator\\n(2)receiver\\n(3)thermal and electrical transport\\n(4)thermal and/or electrical storage\\n(5)turbine/generator\\n(6)power conditioning and load/utility interface.\\nA variety of technologies are currently under investigation for each\\nof these subsystems, each with its own set of design parameters and cost/\\nperformance characteristics. The presentation slides provide a few brief\\nexamples of collector design parameters, thermodynamic cycles, and current\\nengine availability. Key environmental parameters that influence the\\nsystem include meteorological variables such as insolation, temperature,\\nhumidity, pressure, etc., and cost drives such as soil bearing capability,\\nseismic zone, and land availability.\\nThese environmental parameters are directly related to regional con-\\nsiderations. Data profiles for each of themajor meteorological variables\\nhave been derived by SAI for the U.S. based on hourly analysis of SOIMET\\nwiiather tapes at 16 sites. Two primary parameters which affect system\\ncost/performance a ye direct normal insolation and cost of conve ,onal\\nelectricity. The cost-effectiveness (present worth) of a solar system for\\na given configuration is generally proportional to the product o}- \\'.hese two\\nparameters; hence, SAI has used this 6- ict as a cost-effectiveness para-\\nmeter to develop, iii conjunction with irsolation, a regionalization of the\\nU.S. for large grid-connected applications. As shown in the slides, direct\\nnormal insolation values for the U.S. range from 1200 to 2800 KWH/m2.y;\\nindustrial electricity costs for 1976 ranged from .005 to .04 S/kWh; and\\nthe corresponding cost-effectiveness parameters ranged from a low of 5\\n$/m2.y in Washington state (low insolation, low electricity costs) to a\\nhigh of 60 $/m 2.y in Hawaii (high insolation, high electricity costs).\\nTotal electrical energy consumption in the U.S. was about 2.1012 kwh\\nin 1977 for approximately 90 million grid-connected customers. From the\\nIV-34\\naverage use per customer, it is clear that potential grid-connected appli-\\ncations of 1-10 MWe systems are primarily large commercial/industrial/\\ninstitutional, customers. However, various classes or applications have\\nquite different energy requirements based on their key mission require-\\ni\\nments. The profitability orientation of manufacturing establishments, for\\nexample, stands in sharp contrast to the defense mission of military\\ninstallations or the concern of utilities for reliable power generation.\\nAs shown in the presentation slides, these differing mission requirements\\nimply different concerns and issues for solar thermal electric power\\nsystems.\\nA detailed analysis of potential industrial applications was performed\\nbased on energy consumption, electricity costs, load shapes, insolation,\\nand represe •.ative solar system performance and costs. For each 3-digit\\nSIC code ar•-, state, the profitability of solar investment was calculated,\\nand the resulting energy displaced was estimated based on user load shapes\\nand conservative system sizing (turbine/generator output no more than\\naverage daytime demand). As expected, specific industry-state combinations\\nlook attractive because of high electricity costs and/or high insolation;\\nwith total market size also important. Land availability, which is also a\\nkey factor, was not addressed in this analysis because of insufficient\\ndata; nominal land costs were used in the economic analysis.\\nLoad profiles are an important consideration for analyzing the impacts\\nof solar thermal electric systems. SAI has developed a large data base of\\nload profiles for various applications. In line with the interests of many\\nof the workshop attendees, it is interesting to note that military instal-\\nlations provide a mix of activities whose energy demands are very similiar\\nto civilian energy consumption patterns. Military loads reflect a mix of\\nresidential activities, 24-hours continuous industrial and equipment loads,\\nand one or two shift administrative and commercial-type activities. Data\\nis provided in the slides to illustrate these characteristics. Military\\ninstallations are considered to be a favorable application because of the\\ndesire to be independent of utility outages, the availability of manpower\\nfor operation and maintenance, the availability of funding if mission\\nIV-53\\nrequirements are met, and the orientation towards long-term! economics.\\nHowever, a detailed analysis of design requirements (e.g., back-up energy)\\nin relation to mission requirements has not yet been performed.\\nDuring the next fiscal year SAI will develop impact analyses and\\naddress the key issues for a requirements definition of solar electric\\nsystrms. These issues will be addressed in relation to user energy\\nrequirements and site characteristics and will confider system design\\nrequirements, system cost requirements, subsystem performance and func-\\ntional requirements, operational and maintenance requirements, and con-\\nstruction and installation considerations.\\nIV-36\\nPRESENTATION OUTLINE\\n1 OVERVIEW OF IMPACT ANALYSIS AilD REQUIREMENTS DEFINITION STUDY\\n1 SYSTEM PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS\\ni REGIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\\n1 APPLICATIONS CHARACTERISTICS\\n1 NATURE OF SOLAR THERMAL ELECTRIC REQUIREMENTS DEFINITION\\nIV-37\\nSTUDY SCOPE\\n(CURRENTLY BEING MODIFIED)\\n1 1 - 10 MWE SOLAR THERMAL ELECTRIC SYSTEMS\\n1 1985 - 2000 TIME FRAME\\n1 UNITED STATES APPLICATIONS\\n0\\tUTILITIES\\n•\\tINDIVIDUAL USERS\\n1 DETAILED ANALYSIS OF\\n• SYSTEM PERFORMANCE\\n• SYSTEM COST PROJECTIONS\\n• USER IMPACTS\\ni DESIGN REQUIREMENTS\\nIV-38\\na\\nH\\ni\\nSTUDY OBJECTIVES\\n1 ASSESS SOUR THERMAL ELECTRIC TECHNOLOGY STATUS AND DEVELOP PERFORMANCE/COST MODELS\\n1 IDENTIFY POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS OF SOLAR THERMAL ELECTRIC POWER\\ni EVALUATE IMPACTS OF SOLAR THERMAL ELECTRIC SYSTEMS ON\\n•\\tUTILITIES\\n— LARGE UTILITIES\\n— SMALL UTILITIES\\n— DISPERSED ON —SITE GENERATION\\n•\\tINDIVIDUAL LOADS\\n— GRID—CONNECTED\\n— GRID—ISOLATED\\n/ ASSESS DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR SOLAR THERMAL ELECTRIC SYSTEMS\\n•\\tSYSTEM CONFIGURATIONS \\t • FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS\\n• SYSTEM DESIGN PARAMETERS \\t • OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE\\n— COLLECTOR \\t• CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION\\n— STORAGE\\n-- TUR;•INE GENERATOR \\t• SITE REQUIREMENTS\\n— DISPATCH STRATEGY \\t • SAFETY AND LEGAL ISSUES\\nIV-39\\nSOLAR THERMAL ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS\\nKEY STEPS NECESSARY FOR SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS DEFINITION\\nDATA BASE DEVELOPMENT\\n9 SOLAR ELECTRIC SYSTEM\\nCOST/PERFORMANCE\\n• SITE/REGIONAL\\nCHARACTERISTICS\\n• APPLICATION\\nCHARACTERISTICSFY 79 ^--\\ni^FY 80\\nIMPACT ASSESSMENT\\no RELIABILITY (LOSS OF\\nLOAD PROBABILITY)\\ns FUEL DISPLACEMENT\\n(GENERATION DISPATCH)\\n• CAPACITY DISPLACEMENT\\n(EXPANSION PLANNING)\\n• ECONOMIC EFFECTS\\nPENETRATION ANALYSISRC9UIRCM NTS DEFINITION\\ns SYSTEM CONFIGURATION\\n• SYSTEM DESIGN\\n• SYSTEM ECONOMICS\\n• SITE\\n• FIINCT IONAL\\n• OPFRAIIONAL\\n• SATLTY AND LEGAL\\n• CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION\\nIV-40\\n3\\n^i\\ni..\\nGENERIC SOLAR THERMAL ELECTRIC GENERATING PLANT\\nCONCENTRATION/RECEIVER THERMAL TRANSPORT \\tTHERMALSTORAGE\\n•\\tPARABOLOID DISH •WATER/STEAM \\t •_\\nSENSIBLE\\n•\\tPOINT FOCUS FRESNEL •OILS\\t •LATENT (PHASE CHANGE)\\n•\\tOTHER •SALTS\\t •CHEMICAL\\n•LIQUID METALS \\t•HYBRID FOSSIL FUEL\\n•CHEMICAL\\nTURBINE/GENERATOR ELECTRICAL ELECTRICAL\\n•\\tOPEN BRAYTONSTORAGE\\n•\\tCLOSED BRAYTON •\\tDISTRIBUTED •\\tLEAD ACID\\n•\\tSTEAM RANKINE •\\tCENTRAL •\\tSODIUM\\n•\\tORGANIC RANKINEIf\\tIRON REDO\\n•\\tSTIRLING\\n•\\tCOMBINED CYCLES\\nCONDITIONING\\nAND\\tTO\\nLOAD\\nLOAD/UTILITY\\nINTERFACE\\nIV-41\\nPOTENTIAL CONFIGURATIONS\\nDISTRIBUTED GENERATION MODE\\nTHERMODYNAMIC CYCLE\\nCOLLECTOR/KIN\\nRECEIVER BRAYTON\\tIBRAYTON\\tI\\nIRANKINE THROUGH\\nSYSTEM OPEN CLOSED STIRLING  STORAGE COMBINED\\nHeliostat\\nField\\nParabolic a\\t••\\t••\\t• •\\t•\\nDish •\\t••\\t••\\t• •\\t•\\nParabolic\\nTrough\\nFixed\\nMirror\\n• Electrical Transport\\nCENTRAL GENERATION MODE\\nTHERMODYNAMIC CYCLE\\nCOLLECTOR/ \\tf\\nRECEIVER BRAYTON BRAYTONI\\'\\n+ THROUGH\\nSYSTEM OPEN CLOSED STIRLING RANKINE\\tSTORAGE COMBINED\\nHeliostatField 4 0o O i+ D i 0 O SSo\\' Q OI ,\\nParabolicDish( 1000 0(D 0(D 1 (D D (D 0\\nParabolic\\nI•\\t•\\n1•\\t•\\nTrough i •\\t••\\t•\\nFixed •\\t••\\t•Mirror I\\t•\\t••\\t•\\n• Thermal Transport\\n0 Chemical Transport\\nstop• \\t stors\"\\nHyoid \\t ^ No^F ybn0\\nNo stem _\\t Ne SWN-W\\n,HyLnd \\t Ne Hybrid\\nIV-42\\nDISH COLLECTOR PERFORMANCE PARAMETERS\\nRECEIVER EFFICIENCY\\n•\\tABSORPTIVITY\\nCOLLECTOR •\\tRERADIATION LOSSES\\nAREA •\\tCONVECTION LOSSES\\n^\\tA\\t_I(r)^PTET^t)\\nDIRECTfctt)\\t*►R(ACJ©RL) \\tqTET^O^\\nPOWER OUTPUT CONCENTRATOR EFFICIENCY \\tTHERMAL TRANSPORT\\nOF THERMAL INSOLATION •\\tOPTICS\\t EFFICIENCY\\nTRANSPORT_ — REFLECTIVITY \\t •\\tPUMPING LOSSES\\nSUBSYSTEM — TRANSMISSIVITY \\t •\\tTHERMAL LOSSES\\n— ATMOSPHERIC ATTENUATION\\n•\\tINTERCEPT FACTOR\\n— SURFACE ERRORS\\n— TRACKING ERRORS\\n— APERTURE SIZE\\n— OPTICAL LOSSES\\n13\\tGEOMETRY\\n— COSINE LOSSES\\n— SHADING\\nIV-43\\n-^ s ^—\\n`o 0.6\\n.-\\nW\\nCL 0.4\\nc 0.2\\nla\\t2a\\t30\\t4u\\t5o0.8\\n^.aoAPERTURE\\n1.0\\nRa3aSPILLAG\\nLOSSF► ux MRTRIBUTIONCOLLECTOR PERFORMANCE\\nTYPICAL DISH RECEIVER INTERCEPT FACTOR\\nPOINTING ERROR, f\\n(a IS STD.

Significant equipment degradation and data\\nloss car, result without even approaching overall availability requirements.\\nThe effects of power supply disturbances must be reduced to acceptable\\nlevels or eliminated. Possibilities include the following:\\n(1) Modify electronic and computer equipment to be impervious to\\npower disturbances and discontinuities.\\n(a)Design for DC input\\n(b)Provide circuits with greater tolerance for disturbances and\\ndiscontinuities\\n(c)Include energy storage circuits in power supplies to provide\\nride-thru capability.\\nSuggested design parameters may be:\\n*\\tVoltage dips to 60% or rated for a 5Hz period\\n*\\tPulse transients of 500 volts peak to peak up to 1/2Hz\\nduration\\n*\\tFrequency deviation of 1/2Hz.\\n(2) Interposing a motor-generator power conditioner or an uninter-\\nruptible power supply system between the prime source and the computer.\\nEither will function as a buffer to transients.\\nAlthough users may exert some influence upon communications-\\nelectronics equipment design through their procurement specification, in\\nthe past the only option available to communications systems users is the\\npower conditioning option.\\nCurrently, static UPS procurement costs are $1400/KW.

However, this concept allows for maintenance of one unit\\nwhile the other carries the load. Normal operation would consist o f both\\nunits sharing the load. When one fails, only a 50% load transfer would be\\nexperienced. The Navy has had success with a more efficient variation of\\nthis scheme. When one unit operates fully loaded, the other remains off.\\nIf the loaded unit fails, the load transfers to the synchronized bypass\\nuntil the spare unit is turned on. This provides greater energy efficiency\\nbut a 100% load transfer is necessary.\\nV-18\\nSYNCHRONIZED BYPASS BUS \\t STATIC\\nSWITCH\\nt1TILITY \\t REGULATED \\t DC BUS \\t STATIC \\t STATIC\\nINPUT \\t 9ECTIFIER \\ti\\t I INVERTER \\t SWITCH\\nBATTERIES\\nUNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM WITH STATIC BYPASSCRITICA\\nOUTPUT\\nV-19\\nSlide 10\\nThe static bypass switch adds only about 20% to the cost of a non-\\nredundant system but is 8 to 10 times more reliable.

Heating, cooling, and dehumidification are essential to\\ncontinued operation of communications facilities as electrical power\\nitself. But these environmental control systems require power to perform\\ntheir functions and must not be neglected in any power system design. In\\nmost cases environmental control is not critical technical load requiring\\nUPS, but if a standby power source is not on the line quickly, the com-\\nmunication equipment may go down for lack of cooling. Personnel comfort\\nmay not have a direct effect on communication operation, but overall\\nefficiency is degraded in the long run if people are uncomfortable. Ven-\\ntilation of battery rooms might require a few watts of power, but if it is\\ninterrupted for an extended period of time, a disastrous explosion may\\nresult. All these problems must be considered in addition to the basic\\ncommunication/electronics load.\\nOne operational constraint which may not influence non-military com-\\nmunications systems is survivability. The OCS has a wartime role which\\nmust take into account at least partial operation under the affects of\\nnuclear weapons, chemical and biological warfare, electronic warfare,\\nconventional weapons, sabotage, and other unauthorized entry.\\nIn conclusion, the Defense Communications System has a full range of\\npossible applications for alternate power systems, but with some special\\nrequirements such as high availability and survivability. The most prac-\\ntical application at this time is unattended microwave repeater sites.\\nDCEC has tasked the Army to develop an integrated system for such an appli-\\ncation, consisting of photovoltaic cells, thermoelectric generators and\\nbatteries. The success of this should open the door to other larger scale\\napplications in the DCS.\\nV-38\\nOTHER CONSIDERATIONS\\n1.ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL\\n2.SURVIVABILITY\\nThe following question was directed to and answered by Mr. Eugene Phillip,\\nDCA:\\nQ.\\t\"Has the possibility of radioisotopes been explored for uninterrupted\\npower systems?\"\\nA.\\t\"The Army has studied this, but for various reasons designs have not\\nbeen changed to include this possibility.\"\\nComment\\n\"Conceptually, it does not appear that parabolic dish units would be\\nsuitable fo- unattended applications due to the possible maintenance nec-\\nessary to the tracking mechanism, and due to possible adverse weather\\nconditions. On the other hand, the Brayton or combined cycle Stirling may\\nbe quite dependable for such operations as replacements to less efficient\\ndiesels. On larger applications, the point focusing technology may serve\\nmore appropriately since they could also meet space conditioning require-\\nments.\"\\nPliFCEDING PAGE RL.ANK NOT FfU,,rzD\\nV-41\\n\\'.\\nISLAND APPLICATIONS OF CENTRAL RECEIVER SOLAR POWER SYSTEMS\\nEugene M. Grabbe\\nDepartment of Planning and Economic Development\\nState of Hawaii\\nI am delighted to be with you, and as a representative of the Hawaii\\nState government, to share the island environment perspective with you.\\nSolar thermal power can play an important role in island energy supply,\\nespecially if the plant is designed to match the local environment, power\\nrequirements and social expectations. The State of Hawaii is actin=ly\\ninvolved in all facets of alternate energy research, with programs aimed at\\ndeveloping our ample insolation wind, biomass, geothermal, ocean thermal\\nand hydroelectric resources as rapidly as is feasible. Hawaii\\'s Governor,\\nGeorge R. Ariyoshi, has set a goal of energy self-sufficiency, and all\\nother counties of the State are developing individual energy self-\\nsufficiency programs. We have already begun seriously considering solar\\nthermal electric power. In response to a recent U.S. Department of Energy\\nproposal request, a ten-megawatt solar repowering system has been proposed\\nfor the Island of Kauai. This would be a cooperative project of Kauai\\nElectric Co., the University of Hawaii Natural Energy Institute, and Bech-\\ntel Power Corporation. In addition, we are eagerly awaiting DOE\\'s one-\\nmegawatt solar thermal power plant Request for Proposal. Molokai Electric,\\nHawaii\\'s smallest utility, which has an aggressive alternate energy pro-\\ngram, Expects to respond to that program.\\nHawaii works closely on energy and other matters with the other U.S.\\nPacific Islands. We have cooperated in solar planning with Guam, American\\nSamoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, and the Trust Territory\\nof the Pacific Islands. The Trust Territory, as you know, has recently\\nreorganized, and is now the Federated States of Micronesia and two quasi-\\nindependent island groups. So, my experience with the Pacific Islands\\nranges from large, mountainous, heavily-populated islands, such as Hawaii\\'s\\nr \"aCFD\\'NG PAGE BUgHK NOT FILMED\\n.^\\t MED\\nCV-43\\nOahu, to small, sparsely-settled Micronesian atolls. Much of the informa-\\ntion relating to this wide range of islands is applicable to other U.S.\\ne i\\nislands, such as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\\nThe major thing all the U.S. Pacific Islands have in common is a high\\ndependency on imported oil. We have no indigenous fossil fuel resources,\\neither petroleum, natural gas, or coal. Hawaii is over 90 percent depen-\\ndent on oil for energy; the other U.S. Pacific Islands are completely\\ndependent on oil. Although some crude oil and petroleum products are\\nshipped in from the U.S. Mainland, most of the crude oil imports for our\\ntwo refineries are foreign. Thus, the Islands are more susceptible to\\ndislocations in the international oil market than any Mainland State.\\nFurthermore, each island\\'s electric grid is independent. Even in\\nheavily-populated and technically-advanced Hawaii, there are no inter-\\nisland utility entities. The necessary transmission technologies have not\\nyet been shown to be economic. Hawaii has considered submarine cables, but\\nnone have ever been laid at the g-eat depths which occur between the\\nHawaiian Islands. Petroleum m oist, therefore, not only be imported into the\\nState or territory, but shipped from island to island as well.\\nAs you can imagine, our energy costs are highly dependent on the price\\nof oil. In Hawaii, we have among the highest electricity rates in the\\nnation, ranging from over five cents per kilowatt-hour for the first 100\\nkilowatt-hours per month on Oahu, the most densely-populated island, to\\nnine cents per kilowatt-hour on the Island of Molokai. A fuel adjustment\\nclause allows changes in customer rates based on changes in fuel price, so\\nrates can change from one billing period to the next.\\nIt is, however, a different situation in the other U.S. Pacific\\nIslands. In Micronesia and the Northern Marianas, U.S. government sub-\\nsidies keep the customer\\'s electricity cost at approximately three cents\\nper kilowatt-hour, although it costs over seven cents per kilowatt-hour to\\ngenerate. This policy was adopted to encourage economic development, and\\nsome island governments have considered changing it to more accurately\\nreflect the cost of power generation. American Samoan electricity customers\\npay approximately seven cents per kilowatt-hour, and Guam\\'s customers pay\\nV-44\\nt\\napproximately five cents per kilowatt-hour. All these figures are for\\n1977.\\nAll of the U.S. Pacific Islands have a deep interest in reducing their\\ndependence on oil imports, and increasing their use of indigenous, essen-\\ntially inexhaustible resources such as solar radiation. These islands have\\nthe highest annual average insolation rate in the nation. Hawaii averages\\n1,915 Btu per square foot annually, with higher winter incidence than any\\nMainland State. The State\\'s insolation resource is being measured and\\nmapped by the Univer4ity of Hawaii, and for some sites long-term insolation\\ndata have already been gathered by the sugar industry. The other Pacific\\nIslands have not been extensively surveyed for their insolation resource,\\nbut since they lie even closer to the equator than Hawaii does, and since\\ntheir terrain is less mountainous, and fewer clouds are generated, it is\\nsafe to say that their insolation equals or exceeds Hawaii\\'s. These tropi-\\ncal sites in the equatorial zone have little difference between the amount\\nof sunlight available at the winter solstice and at mi-^summer.\\nYou can see that the Pacific Islands share two important character-\\nistics: an ample solar radiation resource, and a great need to reduce oil\\nimports. Both of these factors will encourage the use of solar thermal\\npower. However, there is another shared factor which will limit solar\\nthermal development: lack of land area.\\nBy Mainland standards, Pacific Islands are small. The State of Hawaii\\nencompasses 6,425 square miles of land, with the smallest of the populated\\nmajor islands, Lanai, being approximately 140 square miles. This would be\\nample for solar power generation, if that were the only use for the land.\\nBeinq so limited in land area, however, real estate is one of Hawaii\\'s\\nmajor commodities. With the demands of a growing population, including\\nmore housing, roads, recreation areas, and agriculture, it will be diffi-\\ncult and expensive to obtain large contiguous areas for solar thermal power\\ndevelopment. This does not by any means rule out the solar thermal power\\noption; it just means that sites will have to be carefully sea ,ched for and\\nselected. The other Pacific Islands are even more limited in land cpzce,\\nbut have not yet experienced the same degree of pressure on land use due to\\npopulation.\\nV-45\\nSo, availability of land is a very important limiting factor. The land\\nsituation and the lack of interisland utility interplay tends to favor\\nsmaller solar power plants, sized and sited to meet local needs. What\\nsizes might be best?\\nHawaii is by far the largest power consumer of the U.S. Pacific\\nIslands. In turn, the Island of Oahu, with over 80 percent of the State\\'s\\npopulation, is the largest energy consumer. Oahu now has an installed\\ncapacity of 1,200 megawatts. Compare this with our smallest utility on\\nMolokai, with a capacity of only eight megawatts.\\nThe other U.S. Pacific Islands have even smaller demands. Guam is the\\nlargest power producer, with a capacity of approximately 300 megawatts.\\nSaipan has a capacity of 40 megawatts, and some of the smaller islands have\\ncapacities below one megawatt--ranging from 40 to 600 kilowatts. Almost\\nall of the electricity in the Pacific Island territories is generated by\\ndeisel equipment, much of it antiquated.\\nThis is not to say that the Pacific Islands have all the power they\\nwant or need. In most cases, electricity is only available in the popu-\\nlation centers, leaving the villages without power. Often, the generating\\ncapacity is sufficient to support electric lights and communication\\ndevices, but not enough for refrigeration, which has serious effects on the\\nislands\\' economy and the health of their people. Recognizing the need for\\nmore power to support a more robust economy, and yet realizing that\\ndependence on petroleum imports for economic health can have devastating\\neffects, most Pacific territories\\' governments are seeking ways to increase\\ntheir energy self-sufficiency, utilizing solar and other indigenous energy\\nalternatives.\\nThere are many defense installations on both large and small Pacific\\nislands where solar thermal electric installations may have applications.\\nSuch potential users have not been identified by the State; however, we\\nmaintain close liaison with key energy personnel in U.S. Defense organiza-\\ntions in Hawaii which are headquarters for many Pacific operations. The\\nexperience in civil systems will be applicable to military users.\\nV-46\\nIt seems obvious from the generating capacities which we have just\\nreviewed that the State of Hawaii, Guam, and perhaps a few of the large\\nisluids may be able to use megawatt-range solar thermal installations. The\\nvast majority of the U.S. Pacific Islands, however, cannot support that\\nsize of a plant. Most islands will also be seeking a 24-hour power source,\\nto allow the use of radios, refrigerbtors, and similar appliances. Either\\nstorage or backup generating capacity must be supplied to ensure this\\nrequired reliability. For small remote islands with small population, the\\nradio takes the place of the newspaper and the local people have come to\\ndepend on radio communication for information. This demand could be met by\\nsmall solar thermal electric systems.\\nAnother factor which must be considered when designing equipment for\\nisland environments is the corrosive quality of salt-laden air. In Hawaii,\\nit has been shown that salt corrosion and fouling of reflective surfaces\\ndecreases almost geometrically with distance from the shoreline and eleva-\\ntion above sea level. Hawaii\\'s many mountains help deflect the wind, and\\ncorrosion is not a serious problem inland. The Pacific atolls, howeve?,\\nhave no mountain masses to isolate them from salty winds: the entire\\nislets are, in effect, shoreline. Corrosion is a serious problem which\\nwill effect your choice of materials, and the design of the system. In\\nHawaii, we have already experienced the failure of a small, experimental\\nwind turbine after only a few months of operation due to corrosion in the\\nelectrical system.\\nThe system should also be designed for the social system in which it\\nwill be placed. Hawaii is, compared to most of the other U.S. Pacific\\nIslands, sophisticated technically. We also have little difficulty obtain-\\ning specialized services or materials from the U.S. Mainland, if local\\nresources are not adequate. Elsewhere in the Pacific, however, technical\\nskills are very limited, and the transportation and communication expenses\\nare significant. A system requiring complex, specialized operating and\\nmaintenance skills and procedures may be inappropriate for the remote\\nPacific Islands. What is needed is reliable, simple equipment, easy to\\nunderstand and to .maintain in an island environment.L\\nV-47\\nOf course, insolation is not the Pacific\\'s +ly alternate energy\\nresource. Hawaii has a particularly strong and reliable wind resource, our\\nsteady tradewinds being enhanced by mountain masies. Other Pacific islands\\nmay also have suitable wind regimes, but they have not been as extensively\\nmeasured as Hawaii\\'s has. Furthermore, most Pacific Islands--Hawaii\\nexcluded--are susceptible to typhoon winds. Other energy alternatives\\ninclude geothermal--for Hawaii at least; ocean thermal energy conversion--\\nexcellent surface ocean temperatures and nearshore deep cold water exists\\nsurrounding most Pacific Islands; hydroelectricity is limited by lack of\\nland area and the permeability of tropical soil; and biomass--wastes from\\nagriculture, livestock, and municipalities, as well as crops specially\\ngrown for energy.\\nMany of the smaller islands in the Pacific do not have an extensive\\nbiomass resource. Subsistence agriculture and fishing are major economic \\t =\\nactivities, and do not generate large quantities of wastes. Small, home-\\nstead-sized methane generators are occasionally used, however.\\nIn Hawaii, on the other hand, biomass is an important resource.\\nBagasse, a sugarcane waste, already serves as fuel and provides seven\\npercent of the State\\'s current total energy supply. Trees, hay, pineapple\\nwaste, and other cane trash are all being considered as biomass energy\\nresources.\\nThe use of biomass such as wood chips, sugarcane and pineapple wastes\\nand municipal trash can be used in Hawaii in place of petroleum for steam\\ngenerating plants can supply the backup energy source for solar-thermal\\nelectricity. Since biomass products can be stored after harvest or \"on the\\nstump\" and depend on photosynthesis for growth, such a system would be\\nindependent of petroleum.\\nAlready, as I mentioned earlier, Hawaii and other States have re-\\nsponded to a Federal RFP for a solar thermal installation on top of an\\nexisting conventional power plant. The conventional fuels provide con-\\nsistency and backup, but are not used when the sun is shining brightly.\\nWe can supply this same concept to a biomass-burning power plant.\\nInstead of piggybacking solar thermal and diesel, for example, piggyback\\nV-a8\\n1\\nsolar and wood chips or bagasse. You use each renewable resource to its\\nc best advantage then: solar when it is available, and biomass when the sun\\nis not out. This is an extremely attractive idea in Hawaii, and is already\\nbeing considered by one utility, Molokai Electric, in its long-range plans.\\nIt is equally applicable anywhere with sufficient biomass resources.\\nSo, we\\'ve seen that Hawaii and the other U.S. Pacific Islands have\\nperhaps the nation\\'s best insolation resource. In addition, their high\\ndependence on oil provid^s the best incentive for solar energy development.\\nBecause of the limitations of land and the absence of inter-island utility\\nconnections, small solar thermal units, sized to meet local needs are most\\nappropriate. The island environment poses some design problems, especially\\nto overcome salt corrosion. In areas rich in alternate energy resources,\\nbiomass or some other \"stored\" energy could back up a solar thermal plant.\\nI think you\\'ll agree that the solar potential in the Pacific is great.\\nI look forward to discussing this more with you in our workshop sessions.\\nIn closing I would like to acknowledge the assistance of Andrea Gill of my\\nstaff in the preparation of this presentation,\\nI,\\nV-49\\nI\\nSOLAR THERMAL POWER SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES\\nAlan Poole\\nOffice of Energy,\\nAgency for International Development\\nI have been asked to review the LOC power system in terms that can\\nhelp define applications and requirements for point focusing solar thermal\\npower plants. This is quite a challenge, because the range of electric\\npower systems and associated generating subsystem choices in LDC\\'s is as\\nlarge and diverse as in the developed world. On the one hand we have in-\\ntegrated grids supplying rather large urban loads, such as in southern\\nBrazil where resources, economics; and system size have combined to create\\nthe world\\'s largest power generating station, Haipu Binational. On the\\nother hand, we have large populated areas with no grid and very little\\npower generation.\\nIt is in these more isolated rural areas, away from the grid, that I\\npresume you are most interested. This is fortunate for three reasons(a) it\\nmakes my preparation easier because it is more limited to scope; (b) AID\\nhas shown virtually no interest in urban systems anyway; (c) what little\\nmarket analysis of the kind likely to be of intr_r est `o YOU has been done\\nonly for rural areas. This situation is beginning change. AID is, with\\nimmense reluctance, moving into urban/industrial energy systems. If pro-\\ngrams are intelligently designed, we should have considerable new infor-\\nmation within 4-5 years of the components of urban energy demand (over\\ntime) whicli is essential for either centralized or decentralized solar\\nenergy system design for urban areas.\\nMeanwhile, in rural areas there is riots some momentum towarus el>>ci-\\ndating the microstructure of rural demand, though unfortunately ou r under-\\nstanding is still not very deep. Until very recently AID and other donor\\nprograms to supply electricity to rural areas meant essentially one thing-\\nestablish a grid. This strategy was not very hospitable to careful analy-\\nsis of specific priority applications to determine how lit!\\'ie capacity\\nV-51PRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT F11W\\nED\\nNr\\ncould be installed, since the objective was to uncover as large a latent\\ndemand as possible in order to spread the heavy investment in subtrans-\\nmission and distribution. As a consequence, cost benefit analysis con-\\nsisted of a shotgun fired at a multiplicity of miscellaneous uses, many of \\t 1\\nwhich certainly did not immediately impact the productivity of the local\\neconomy.\\nThis does not mean that these \"nonproductive\" uses are undesirable,\\nand we anticipate that classical rural electrification will proceed. How-\\never, there is also an argument that given limited financial resources and\\nthe large number of settlements with virtually no power, it is both more\\nequitable and mora efficient economically to pinpoint \"strategic\" welfare\\nor productivity enhancing loads throughout a country. In this case it is\\nquite possible that even with a higher unit cost per delivered kwh more\\nstrategic loadii can be supplied with a given rural electrification invest-\\nment budget than with the classical approach. This kind of thinking seems\\nto be gaining favor with time, and it is, of course, good news for those\\ninterested in technologies adapted to decentralized applications. This\\napproach, however, requires that we have a clearer idea of just what these\\nloads and their specifications are. It also puts on pressure to develop\\ntechnologies which are better adapted to rural requirements than the\\ncurrent generation of diesel generating sets.\\nSome loads have been identified; these include:\\n(1)Refrigeration 100 to 1000 watts\\n(2)Communication Systems 10 to 1000 watts\\n(3)Water Pumping 150-1000 watts\\n(4)Medical Appliances 200 to 2000 watts\\nNote their small size. Small industrial loads present a more complex\\npicture, and have not been adequately analyzed.\\nThe scales shown here are for highly disaggregated loads. In general,\\nin the past, decentralized power systems (whether using minihydro or diesel\\ngenerators) have been built at a larger scale, generally over 10 KW or 25\\nKW. There may be intrinsic factors in the demand situation leading to this\\noutcome, and a market at this scale will undoubtedly persist. However, to\\nV- 52\\nsome extent the scale may have been determined by the characteristics of\\ndiesel generating sets in use today.\\nI would like to focus on the more disaggregated loads in part because\\nyou are probabl; less familiar with them and some of the most interesting\\napplications are being designed for them today, and in part because they\\nP\\nwill provide a basis for comparison with the more conventional decentra-\\nlized approach. \\t ,\\nWater pumping is a good example. Land tenure patterns and ground\\nwater levels in many areas of the Third World are such that small inde-\\npendently powered pumps on the order of 15-300 W could be very valuable in\\nincreasing irrigation. Until now no viable, proven technology has existed\\nto supply this market. Photovoltaics, of course, are being investigated.\\ni\\nI have heard , but not yet been able to confirm, that the Government of\\nIndia is planning a very substantial implementation program usinq cells\\nmanufactured primarily in India. A possible competitor, however, is a free\\npiston Stirling engine in a configuration which uses the mechanical vibra-\\ntion of the engine directly. We hope to test prototypes of this engine in\\nthe next year or two and one of the candidate heat sources is point-focused\\nsolar energy. The problem with using direct solar in this way is that the\\ncollector has been estimated to cost twice as much as the engine itself on\\na mass production basis. However, cheaper collectors may be designed. In\\nHyderabad, parabolic mirrors have been designed which have a material cost\\nof $6.00 and could supply 100 W of power. An intriguing feature of these\\nvery small systems is that the construction requirements for collectors may\\nbe much simplified, ergo cheaper, for normal weather conditions wh*:le it is\\nquite possible that peasants would be willing to store collectors ir, a safe\\nplace during storms or idle periods (that is substitute labor fot capital).\\nIn designing systems it is important not to assume that an Indian peasant\\nhas the same requi rements for convenience that an American user does. Mote\\ntoo that power does not necessarily mean electric power.\\nVery small scale applications of Stirling engines (perhaps also for\\nrefrigeration and electricity generation) represent the only moi l in our\\nV-53\\noffice at present towards high temper-Ature solar thermal power applica-\\ntions. The project has not yet been fully worked out or approved as yet,\\nhowever.\\nSmall scale applications place at the outset several key demands on\\nenergy systems. Their operation and routine maintenance should be simple,\\nthey should be reliable, and their capital costs should be as low as pos-\\nible because the relative cost of capital is higher in LDC\\'s. Maintenance\\n\"eliability are criteria where currently used diesels fail. To be\\nssful new systems should represent a significant improvement here.\\nThis may be more important than whether or not they use oil.\\nMany engineers with experience in LDC\\'s believe that in general we\\nneed to take a new look at heat engines for use in LDC\\'s, perhaps to as\\nlarge a scale as 10 MW and irregardless of the energy source used. We hope\\nto encourage thoughtful work in this direction in the near future.\\nIn general we do not see a large export market emerging here, at least\\nfor complete units.\\nBy large, we mean a major fraction of the domestic market. Much solar\\nequipment is capital intensive, and few LDC\\'s have shown much desire to\\nsubstitute imports of energy capital equipment for imports of oil, unless\\nthe payback time is short. This does not mean that a market for special\\napplications will not exist, or that AID will not subsidize some\\ndemonstrations--but both are limited. AID in particular has a total\\neconomic assistance budget (excluding Egypt and Israel) of $1.2 billion,\\nwhich is stagnant and much blood is split in reallocating even a few\\nmillion dollars. The days when AID financed 2/3 of U.S. electrical gen-\\nerating equipment exports to LDC\\'s are gone.\\nA more promising strategy is to concentrate on licensing or joint\\nproduction agreements and export of crucial components (particularly those\\nwhich require long production runs). There may be many interesting oppor-\\ntunities here as solar technologies develop. From the perspective of a\\nprivate firm AID\\'s role here is likely to be definition and demonstration\\nof a market, while OPIC (Overseas Private Investment Corporation) can help\\ninsure against political and other risks. I must emphasize that AID does{\\nV-54\\nnot see itself as a marketing agency for U.S, industry, but in energy AID\\'s\\n(and its umbrella organization, the International Development Cooperation\\nAgency) activities are, in future, likely to have this brokerage element in\\nthem in practice.\\nV-55\\nThe following questions were directed to and answered by Mr. Alan Poole,\\nAID:\\niI\\tQ.\\t\"What are the motives and objectives of AID?\"\\nA. \"The basic purpose of AID is the development of income and sta-\\nbility in developing countries. This is not equivalent to the imme-\\ndiate extension of U.S. commercial aims. However, as has occurred in\\nthe past, our involvement with developing countries has an indirect,\\neffect on the commercial market which these countries open to the\\nU.S.\"\\nQ. \"Considering the great distances involved in these cases, product\\ndelivery, transportation, and maintenance costs will be phenomenal.\\nThis is not including operational training and warrantee costs. Who\\nwill absorb these extra costs or responsibilities?\"\\nA. \"Traditionally this has been taken care of by the Rural Electrifi-\\ncation Authority of the country involved. Service agreements would\\nvary from country to country. This problem dramatically emphasizes\\nthe necessity for simplicity and reliability in these systems.\"\\nQ. \"Since the proposed solar systems would replace existing diesels and\\nassuming that there now exists operational maintenance capabilities\\nfor these, would this same level of skills be sufficient for the\\nmaintenance of Stirling or Brayton engines?\"\\nA.\\t\"Perhaps the best way to answer tris question is through actual\\ninstallation and operation in suitable locations.\"\\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FLMED\\nV-57\\nQ. \"An expert on OPEC has said that they (OPEC) are unwilling to buy all\\nnew U.S. systems; however, they are willing to enter into cooperative\\nagreements whereby in the first 5-10 years they would buy just the\\nsystems and then buy the factories. Is there any continent on this?\"\\nA.\\t\"Most likely that is the direction that will be taken.\"\\nQ. \"Have any studies been done concerning introduction of intermediate\\nlevel technology in developing countries as it relates to economic\\ndevelopment? It seems as though there should be a cost effective way\\nto introduce new technology (considering the level of indigenous skill\\nnecessary for systems maintenance) without reverting back to 18th\\ncentury technology. The goal of economic development is not neces-\\nsarily served by utilizing more basic technology if more advanced\\ntechnology is feasible.\"\\nA. \"In all probability this has been considered whether or not a formal\\nstudy has been perfurmed. Surprises are expected now as older tech-\\nnologies are brought down off the shelf and explored for their poten-\\ntials. In a general sense, what is being done with solar and wind\\nresearch is simply an extension of 18th and 19th century technology\\nthat has simple, basic, and workable foundations. So the idea pre-\\nsented has a good deal of merit..\"\\nQ.\\t\"What would be an Appropriate perspective of the foreign market for\\nU.S. solar thermal technology?\"\\nA. \"Long controversial discussions can and do evolve from a question of\\nthis nature; however, it is possible to summarize the situation. The\\nresponse of most developing countries is receptive. with exceptions.\\nIt is generally found that these countries are willing to buy the\\ntechnology, to buy components, and even to open doors to manufacturing\\nV-58\\nplants. The exception is that the countries do not want the tech-\\nnology nor the industries to be isolated from the populace through\\ncomplete U.S. control. The country must be allowed access to and\\nparticipation in the industries.\"\\nt\\n}\\nR\\ne\\nV-59\\nA RELATED SOLAR THERMAL APPLICATION\\nSOLAR THERMAL PRODUCTION OF MOBILIT`! FUELS\\n0. W. Gregg, R. W. Taylor and J. H. Campbell\\nLawrence Livermore Laboratory\\nr A preliminary evaluation of the technical and economic feasibility of\\nsolar thermal production of mobility fuels has been perfo med. The analy-\\nsis indicates that therr, are three areas where solar thermal energy could\\nprovide a major assist i-n the production of mobility fuels in the near to\\nintermediate term. They are Solar Coal Gasification, Solar Oil Shale\\nRetorting and Solar Steam Flooding of Oil Fields. It. is assumed that solar\\nassisted production of mobility fuels starting from a fossil fuel resource\\nwill be more economically viable in the near to intermediate term than\\nsolar fuel systems that start from CO 2 and H2O.

A generator set that is difficult to detect by visual and aural\\nmeans will enhance the combat capability of friendly tactical units,\\nallowing weapons and surveillance systems along with other support equip-\\nment having electric power requirements to be deployed in forward areas.\\nOperation of a vehicle engine to drive its generator and maintain battery\\ncharge in stationary use creates poor fuel efficiency, rapid and undue wear\\nof the vehicle engine, and makes the vehicle susceptible to enemy detection\\nbecause of its sound and high IR heat source. Existing generator sets are\\ndesigned for one fuel. Some combat vehicle engines require automotive\\ngasoline and others use diesel fuel. For generator sets to be logistically\\nand tactically compatible with their transport vehicles, multifuel design\\nis desirable (provided the energy process is other than a piston engine\\ndriven electrical power generator or unless the energy process provides\\nbenefits that outweight the logistical penalty of a single or special\\nfuel).\\nStudies conducted by Army and other agency development activities con-\\nclude that establishment of the proposed family of silent power sources is\\nfeasible and within the state of the art for a number of advanced energy\\nconversion technologies. Rankine cycle engine-generators and fuel cells\\nappear to be the most attractive for the power ratings up to approximately\\nVII-16\\n1.5KW GED\\n600\\n80\\n2.0 - 2.2\\nGasoline\\n10001.5KW F.C.\\n600 - 1000\\n70\\n.75 - .9L\\nMetharil\\n10005KW; and an enclosure-silenced, open Brayton cycle is appropriate for\\nratings above 5KW. Other development considerations include Wankel-engine\\ngenerators (developments being pursued by UK and FRG); Stirling-cycle\\nengine generators; and multi-fuel thermoelectric generators for low power\\nratings. SLEEP generators will be authorized only in those specified units\\nwhere noise discipline is essential to the performance of ^;actical mis-\\nsions, e.g., maneuver brigades and forward.\\nThe 1.5KW fuel cell is the first member of the Family (.5 to 5KW) to\\nbe developed. The initial d4sign is a phosphoric acid electrolyte fuel\\ncell with a hydrogen generator using a methanol reformer. Development of a\\nhydrocarbon fuel cell is scheduled under the SLEEP program. This thermal\\ncatalytic system will produce hydrogen from gasoline, diesel or JP-4. The\\nhydrogen will be used with currently available hydrogen-air feel stacks.\\nThe cracker, stacks and control equipment will constitute a set.\\nParameters and characteristics for SLEEP are listed 0 Figure 6.\\nPredicted performance parameters compared to current standard set\\n(1.5KW GED) are shown.\\niParameters\\n1st Cost - $/KW\\nWt - Lbs/KW\\nFuel - Lbs/KWHR\\nFuel\\nNoise - Meters\\n(Inaudibility)\\nAs previously mentioned, the Engineer School is coordinating two power\\nrelated requirements. On deals with solid state power conditioners and the\\nother with a standardized power distrioution system for units in the field.\\nThe concept is to use power conditioners and only 60Hz tactical utility\\ntype generators. Power conditioners will provide for frequency and voltage\\nconversion; and will provide for uninterrupted Dower when supported with\\nVII-17\\nstorage batteries, fuel cells, commercial power or other auxiliary power\\nsources. Characteristics such as weight, size and cost savings realized\\nfrom the simplification of current generators are key to the acceptance of\\nthe concept.\\nThe increasing complexity of electric power requirements within units\\nhas increased the danger of injury or death to those deploying distribution\\nsystems and of damage to generators and weapons systems. Methods and\\nequipment used for unit power distribution must be simpler, safef , and\\nstandardized. A Standard Family of Power Distribution systems will perform\\nprocessing functions such as circuit paralleling. Standardized cables and\\nconnectors, keyed and sized for voltage and amperage will be used. The\\nsystem will contain circuit breakers, grounding equipment and protection\\nagainst electromagnetic pulse (EMP).\\nThe overall goal of these two requirements is to reduce the types of\\ngenerators to 60 Hz AC with standardized distribution systems delivering\\npower to using equipment. Power requirements other than 60 Hz AC will be\\nprovided by use of solid state power conditioners located at the using\\nequipment.\\nCurrently Available Power Generators\\nIn the early 60\\'s the numbers of different makes, models and sizes of\\nfield generators in the DOD inventory had risen to over 2000. Logistic\\nsupport was unmanageable. In 1967 a DOD Project Manager was established as\\nthe single focal point for mobile electric power. This office has estab-\\nlished a standard DOD Family of Mobile Electronic Power Generators con-\\nsisting of about 40 different generators. Figure 8 contains the members of\\nthe DOD Standard Family of Power Generators.\\nArmy Uses of MEP\\nCurrently the Army uses all sizes up to 200 kw as mobile generators.\\nThe larger sizes are used for installation power. The numbers of the\\nvarious kw -atings in the DOD inventory provide an insight as to the\\nexisting size of the Army power market. Roughly 10% of the number of\\ngenerators fielded is used as an annual replacement factor.\\nVII-18\\nt\\naSome of the kw ratings between .5 and .10 will be replaced by SLEEP\\ngenerators. The ROC for the SLEEP generators originally stated that a\\nfigure of 91,944 SLEEP generators would be fielded. This uses the number\\nresulting from a one for one replacement scheme. The procurement plan now\\nenvisions using SLEEP generators only in brigade and forward areas. The\\nchanges resulting from this concept are shown in Figure 10.\\nEXISTING NEW\\nITEM NUMBER NUMBER\\n1.5 kw60hz 22051 6139\\n1.5 kw28V DC 11475 3058\\n3.0 kw60Hz 15820 1824\\n3.0 kw400 Hz 2379 1235\\n3.0 kw28V DC 10$10 3700\\n5.0 kw60Hz 21813 1446\\nThe existing numbers cannot be justified on a cost and operationally effec-\\ntive basis at this time.\\nMEP Problems\\nAssuming that complaints received from field users can be related to\\nproblems with the current MEP sets, the greatest problems reported deal\\nwith reliability and noise. Field units want generators that run longer\\nwithout constant attention. Generators must run more hours without\\nrequiring repair at the unit level. Field units say that generators are so\\nnoisy their noise can be used to locate the unit. This is a tactical\\nvulnerability that the SLEEP sets are designed to reduce. The noise from\\ncurrent generators makes verbal communications difficult and can cause\\nhearing damage. Design of future generator sets must consider noise sup-\\npression measures.\\nVII-19\\nA.\\nr.\\nA third potential problem is fuel. DOD is trying to reduce the\\nrequirement for gasoline on the battlefield. Diesel engines are supplant-\\ning gasoline engines in increasing numbers. However, this does not reduce\\nsignificantly the overall requirement for liquid fossil fuels. In view of \\t {\\nuncertainties in availability of liquid fossil fuels, new fuels and engines\\nthat can use them should be a high priority research item. A major con-\\nsideration with introducing a new fuel will be the handling and storage\\nrequirements associated with the specific: fuel.\\nA potential problem under investigation is infrared emissions. Gen-\\nerators emit IR signatures that can easily be detected by electronic\\nsensors at considerable distances. Thus, the generator and in turn the\\nweapon systems it is supporting can be vulnerable to attack, especially\\nwhen guided heat seeking munitions are used. Parameters are being devel-\\noped for use as design criteria for suppression measures.\\nOperational Constraints\\nThe Army must be prepared to fight worldwide in all climates, day or\\nnight, against well trained and equipped opponents, in a nuclear environ-\\nment, and WIN. The current emphasis is on the European battlefield but the\\ntheaters of operatioi;-; must not be overlooked. Thus, natural operational\\nconstraints exist. Others are the result of technical considerations.\\nOver the years, Military Standards and Specifications have been developed\\nin an effort to standardize equipment. These guidelines also impose con-\\nstraints on equipment development.\\nOne of the most important constraints (requirements) of the Army in\\nthe field is mobility. Mobility can be equated to transportability.\\nSeveral considerations make transportability a critical factor in equipment\\ndesign.\\nCounterfire equipment has become so sophisticated that many units must\\nadopt \"Shoot - and - Scoot\" tactics to survive. The ability to \"Scoot\"\\ndepends on mobility. The Army has developed a standard Family of\\ngenerator/trailer and truck combinations which will maximize transport-\\nability. Descriptive data on the combinations is contained in TM 750-5-32,\\nVII-20\\nArmy Equipment Data Sheets, Generator Sets and Electric Power Plants, Truck\\nand Trailer Mounted.i\\nCurrently, generators are restricted to using the same fuels that are\\nprovided as fuel for Army vehicles. There is good rationale for the\\nrestriction. Most of the generators are driven by internal combustion\\nengines as are the vehicles. The amounts of fuel used by generator sets is\\nsmall in comparison to that used by vehicles. It then follows that bulk\\nfuel handling equipment should be, and is, designed to handle fuels used by\\nvehicles. This philosophy results in minimizing the number of types of\\nfuels required on the battlefield. In 1973, it became obvious that a\\nshortage of petroleum fuels could develop that would put the Army in a\\nhighly vulnerable position.\\nIt is recognzied that petroleum fuels will be required for the fore-\\nseeable future. Prudence, therefore, requires a significant reduction in\\ndependence upon petroleum fuels. This can be achieved, in part, by\\nexploiting different energy sources and synthetic fuels and development of\\nengines appropriate for their use.\\nUnits in the field have a tendency to consider reliability as an\\nunalienable right and maintenance as a necessary evil to be accomplished\\nonly when absolutely necessary. This attitude is understandable. The\\nreason the unit is in the field is to accomplish a mission. It has\\nspecialized equipment designed to accomplish the mission, for example, an\\n8\" Artillery gun. The generator that provides power is considered a\\nsapport item; the gun is the mission essential item. Any time spent on\\nst_r icing and maintaining the generator detracts from time available for\\noperating the mission essential item. This attitude may sound unrealistic.\\nHowever, the mechanic who repairs the generator doubles in brass. He is\\nalso the mechanic who repairs the truck that hauls ammunition for the\\n811 The mission essential item will be given priority of attention.\\nFrom a lifecycle cost and operational effectiveness viewpoint, the equip-\\nment that has a higher initial acquisition cost and lower upkeep cost\\n(people, fuel, and parts) will probabily be chosen over an item with a low\\nacquisition cost and high upkeep cost. The cost of owning the item is\\nVII-21\\nA e\\nlower. Therefore, units want generators that run longer and require less\\nmaintenance and upkeep.\\nInternal combustion engines and gas turbines are inherently noisy\\nbecause combustion noises are exhausted to open air. Even though mufflers\\nare attached, decibel levels from current generator sets range from around\\n85 to 100 dBa. noise at this level causes hearing damage, interferes with\\nspeech and permits aural detection or location of generators at a distance.\\nMIL-STD 1474A, Noise Limits for Army Materiel, Mar 75, provides design\\nstandards developed from consideration of hearing damage-risk, speech \\t g\\nintelligibility, aural detection, and state-of-the-art of noise reduction.\\nThe standards are intended to cover typical operational conditions.\\nThe ROC for the SLEEP generators mentioned above stated a requirement\\nfor inaudibility at 100 meters. MIL  STD 1474A states that the following\\noctave band pressures at a measurement distance of 6 meters must not be\\nexceeded in any band if non-detectability is to be achieved at 100 meters.\\nLimiting Octave Band Levels (dB) for Aural Non-Detectability\\nHz 63\\t125 250 500 lk 2k 4k 8k\\ndb 60\\t46 44 45 45 46 47 48\\nThe above data provides guidance for inaudibility at 100 meters.\\nWhile materiel developments are proceeding, an area of indecision exists\\nconcerning the distance. The distance in the ROC was established for a\\njungle environment. The question of whether 100 meters is appropriate for\\nthe European battlefield is under investigation. If the non-detectability\\ndistance can be extended to say 400 meters, sound suppression measures\\nshould result in a lesser amount of weight and cost. Of course, if an\\nappreciable decrease in the distance is necessary, the reverse would be\\ntrue.\\nInfrared or thermal signatures produced by military equipment has been\\nthe source of growing concern to the military in recent years. Thermal\\ndetection and heat seeking munition technology nas advanced to the point\\nVII-22\\n1i\\nwhere, if the heat source can be detected, it can be hit. The vulnera-\\nbility that exists must be overcome or survival of equipment on the battle-\\nfield will be precarious, at best. Thermal blankets, enclosures and direc-\\ntional exhausts have achieved varying measures of thermal suppression on\\nexisting equipment. An opportunity exists with equipment in the design\\nstage to exploit available technology to reduce the inherent thermal signa-\\nture. Then, if additional measures are necessary, a greater overall reduc-\\ntion of thermal signatures should be attainable.\\nVisual detection and recognition of an item depends primarily on its\\nshape or silhouette. Other cues, such as color, reflections and motion,\\ncontribute to visual detection of an item. Visual observation is con-\\nsidered to be direct observation with the unaided eye or augmented by use\\nof optical equipment. Interpretation of aerial photography is generally\\nconsidered to be direct observation. The effective range of ground based\\nvisual observation is about 3-4 kilometers. This figure is the result of\\nterrain indulations, vegetation, and other obscurants on the battlefield.\\nAerial observation extends the range to much farther distances. Again, if\\nan item can be seen, it can be hit. Therefore, distinctive shapes, reflec-\\ntions from glossy surfaces and unnecessary movement either of parts of the\\nequipment or of people around the equipment must be avoided.\\nLiquid Fuel/Solar Heat Combustion System\\nIn theory, an engine that can use any form of fuel found loca l, iy to\\ndrive a generator should be ideal. For installation or semi-permanent\\npower requirements, such a flexibility in choice of fuels can result in\\nsystem design and operational cost savings. Fuel options have long been a\\nmajor consideration when designing a commercial power plant. Several\\nconditions, both logistical and tactical in nature, reduce the flexibility\\nin fuel choice for MEP generators used in the field. Meat engines can be\\ncalled multi-fuel engines in that they can by using different, combustion\\nequipme,t burn several types of liquid fuels, or gaseous fuels, or solid\\nfuels or obtain heat from a solar source. One combustion t9chnique cannot\\nVII-23\\nt\\ni\\nburn all liquid and solid fuel efficiently. Thus, to maximize fuel flexi-\\nbility, the Army inventory would contain several types of combustion equip-\\nment which can be used interchangeably based on fuels found locally.\\nAlternatively, the Army must choose one or at ni.st two combustion tech-\\nniques and develop a logistic system based on the associated fuel(s). Only \\tAf\\na complex cost and operational effectiveness analysis could determine which\\nof the above options would be more effective. Intuitively, I would choose\\nthe alternative with fewer combustion techniques because on the surface it\\nwould appear to be easier to support logistically. Of course, it is just\\nthis philosophy which led the Army to standardize an internal combustion\\nengine\\'s burning gasoline and diesel as fuel. This philosophy is valid as\\nlong as the chosen fuels are readily available. The Army now finds that\\nbecause of uncertain availability of liquid petroleum fuels, it is prudent\\nto investigate the potentials of different fuels and engines appropriate\\nfor their use. The fuel to be acceptable must not significantly add to the\\nexisting logistic burden. The engine must reduce logistical support and\\nmeet operational requirements contained in approved requirements documents.\\nIf the fuel can replace liquid petroleum fuels for production of electric\\npower under the above conditions, the impact of a serious fuel shortage may\\nbe reduced.\\nIntroduction of a new fuel for generators may have some adverse\\nimparts which must be considered. An example is the logistical impacts\\nwhich would result from the introduction of methanol as a fuel. Methanol\\nwill require a dedicated handling system. This is an undesirable but\\nprobably inevitable situation. Another consideration is the percentage of\\nliquid fuel saved in relation to the overall requirement. A cost/benefit\\nratio analysis may show that the percentage saved is so small as to not\\noutweigh the cost of handling required. An indication of the relative fuel\\nsavings percentage is indicated:\\ni\\nVII-24\\nt\\nEquipmenta g 1/hr\\ns\\tXMI Tank \\t 34.3\\nM113 Carrier \\t 5.6\\n5T Cargo Truck \\t 3.0\\n5 KW Generator \\t 1.4\\n5/4 T Truck \\t 1.2\\nThe figures are relative but they do indicate intuitively that the\\namount of fuel used by generators is a minor percentage of the total fuel\\nrequirement.\\nModular vs. Single Unit Systems\\nModularity provides maximum potential of flexible arrangement to\\nachieve a total power requirement. A family of appropriately sized single\\nunit generators provides the modularity required. Some constraints to a\\ncompletely modular system must be considered. The numbers of modules that\\ncan be combined are limited by the sizes of trailers and trucks available\\nfor transport of generators. A standard family of Power Units has been\\ndeveloped for Army use. Basically, the goal of the family is to stand-\\nardize designs and prevent proliferation of both design and sizes of trans-\\nport equipment. The current family is contained in TM 750-5-32. With rare\\nexception, the number of generators mounted on a trailer or truck has been\\nlimited to two. This limit was established to minimize the size of trans-\\nport equipment. In addition, the numbers of trailers and trucks available\\nto tow trailers have been severely reduced in Army units. Therefore, a\\nsystem that requires additional numbers of either trailers or trucks will\\nnot be received favorably by the users. They will not have trucks to tow\\nthe trailers, nor people to drive additional trucks.\\nParalleling of generators is already a standard practice in the Army.\\nProcedures and techniques are contained in Army publications such as\\nVII-25\\nFM 20-31, Electric Power Generation in the Field. In the design of genera-\\nLion equipment, consideration must be given to the fact that there is no\\nformal training for generator operators. The operations of generators and\\nthe deployment of power distribution cables within units is usually accom-\\nplished as an additional duty by low ranked soldiers. Paralleling proce-\\ndures must, therefore, be appropriately uncomplicated.\\nSummary\\t -\\t\\nThe U.S. Army Engineer School recognizes the urgency and necessity for \\t =_\\nreducing the Army\\'s dependence on liquid petroleum fuels. It also recog-\\nnizes certain impacts on the Army that will result from successful develop-\\nment of synthetic fuels and engines appropriate for their use. Early\\nexchange of information between representatives of equipment users and\\nresearch analysts is extremely important.\\nWhen analysts are aware of user requirements and constraints and the\\nrationale for their existence, the introduction of the resulting equipment\\ninto the Army can be accomplished with much less turbulence. This is\\nbecause the item invariably has more utility designed into it.\\nIn closing, I want to restate two points:\\nIt is essential that the Army be provided with power plants having\\nimproved reliability, increased service life and reduced, simplified main-\\ntenance.\\nTo insure an ability to accomplish its missions, the Army must reduce\\nits dependency on petroleum fuels. New fuels and engines for their\\nefficient use must be developed.\\nVII-26\\n1.The following questions were directed to and answered by Mr. Tom Batty,\\nUSAES:\\na\\nQ. \"Considering that :ne Army is looking for replacements for the gaso-\\nline engines that currently power generating systems, if an advanced\\nefficient Stirling or Brayton cycle heat engine were to be available\\nin comparable sizes, would the Army seek procurement?\"\\nA. \"Certainly an engine that is quiet, efficient, cheap, simole, adapt-\\nable and can be operated by anyone is quite in demand. Such an engine\\nwould definitely be considered.\"\\nQ. \"Does the basic design of the existing IOKW gas turbine generator make\\nit amenable to modification for acceptance of a solar- heat source in\\naddition to other fuel sources?\"\\nA. \"A baseline engine that is being proposed for solar energy is cur-\\nrently natural gas design that can accept any fuel. This is a dif-\\nferent type engine than is manufactured elsewhere. There are techno-\\nlogies that utilize combustible heat sources and can be adopted to\\nconvective heat receivers.\"\\nQ.\\t\"Is the IR signature known for solar engines working in this mode?\"\\nA. \"Openly there is quite a bit of controversy over opinions. The work\\nthat is being done on this topic is classified. Appropriate inquiries\\nand clearances could obtain this information. It can be said that a\\ntemperature differential of a few (1-2) degrees can be pinpointed at\\nvery long distances.\"\\nVII-21\\nm4\\nComment\\n\"It should be noted that there are quite a few parameters other than\\ntemperature gradients that must be considered when analyzing target vulner-\\nability.

Waugh, Jr.\\nCurtis Engine and Equipment, Inc.\\n1\\nFor the past thirty years Curtis Engine has been selling and renting\\nEngine Powered Generators. Curtis had an informal program for Rental Power\\nuntil 1976. At that time a formal program and department was created.\\nWe have supplied generators under the Rental Program for over 25\\nstates and more than 30 countries. Our generators are backup power for\\nhospitals, industry, government, military, and security services.\\nWhen the call comes, Curtis is there, at 2 in the afternoon or at 2 in\\nthe morning, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Complete mechanical\\nservice backs the Rental Fleet at all times.\\nThe Rental Program and Fleet is based in Baltimore. Our locations in\\nWashington, Norfolk, and Wilmington all are storage locations for the\\nrental fleet. With central control of the Rental Program the most appli-\\ncable equipment can be supplied for the customer\\'s needs.\\nCurtis Engine is not a rental house. We are regional distributors of\\ndiesel engines, gene-ators, and generator sets/systems. These products\\ninclude Onan, Perkins, Allis Chalmers, Chrysler, and White Hercules. Our\\nfacilities produce custom built generator sets from 5 kilowatts to 1 mega-\\nwatt.\\nThe Rental Market for Engine Powered Generators has grown over the\\npast ten years. The more demand for our electrical ! power, the increasing\\ngrowth the Rental Market will experience.\\nWherever people are working or playing you will find an increasing\\nneed for electric generating sets. This need may be for a few seconds or\\nup to a few years. The applic°` 4ons for Rental Generators come in all\\ntypes, sizes, and shapes. The reasons for \"Rental\" can range widely. For\\nthe purpose of:\\nA.\\tA temporary need for electrical service.\\nVII-29\\n3.\\tOr a need for power at one or more locations to meet , specific\\nneed or needs.\\nThe Rental and Sales markets for generators are normally closely\\nrelated. The major difference is the Sales Market also serves the loat;/\\npeak sharing market.\\nWe have provided Rental generators for 2 1/2 kilowatt to the megawatt \\t T\\nrange. Hospitals, ships, industries, schools, shops, churches, Army, Navy,\\nCoast Guard, Air Force, lighting companies, sound companies, EPA, DOD, DOE,\\nadvertising, Boy Scouts, Single Phase, Three Phase, 50 Hertz, 60 Hertz, 110\\nvolts to 600 volts.\\nRental generators have provided prime and backup power for hospitals,\\nships, industrial, offices, etc., and 50 hertz power for government and\\nindustry. One unit provided pow,;r to test a computer used to judge the\\nMiss Universe Contest this year.\\nWe have developed a 30 kilowatt noise reduced unit we call our Silent\\nElectrical Power System. This unit has provided power with low noise\\nlevels for Radio and Television Productions, Movie Locations, Music and\\nTheatrical Groups. The unit was field tested on Preakness Day in the\\ninfield at Pimlico Race Track, Baltimore. Over 70,000 people were con-\\ntained in the infield. The generator provided power for the rock groups\\nNantucket and Appalossa.\\nOver the past years the Rental Market has tieen developed by customer\\nand potential customer education. Educated to the advantages of a Renal\\nUnit. The advantages of availability, convenience, and economics. The\\nRental Unit is available immediately. The Unit can be moved from location\\nto location.\\nThe time is near where the factor of ECONOMICS will play an increasing\\nroll in the Rental Market. The cost of temporary service from the utility\\nis growing. The utility is increasing the cost for temporary service to\\nmeet their actual cost. In the past the charges for temporary service were\\nbelow actual cost for the utility to install the temporary lines. The\\nutility recovering the additional ;nstallation cost through the monthly\\npower consumption charges.\\nVII-30\\nWith the temporary service charges increasing and the installation\\ntime of 90 to 150 days common, more and more contractors are turning to the\\nRental Generator.\\nAdditionally the utilities are starting to charge for demand or peak\\ntimes. The construction and industrial areas\\' users are testing the ^:se of\\na Rental Generator to provide a portion or all of their needs during the\\npeak rate hours.\\nA clothing manufacturer in a Western Maryland plant is divided into\\ntwo identical production lines with the same power consumption. The utility\\nprovided the power for one line and a Rental Generator provided the power\\nfor the second line. Due to the higher charges from the utility (during\\nthe coal strike in 1978) and the increased demand charges, the manufacturer\\nprovided 50% of his own power. Using a total cost program of Rental, Fuel,\\nMaintenance, and Repair, the \"Rental Power\" was 10 to 12% lower than the\\nutility power.\\nThis economicai approach is increasing as the cost of electrical\\nservice grows. This approach is from the monetary standpoint and not the\\nenergy conservation approach.\\nRental generators fall into two major types of general utilization.\\nThese types are:\\nA.MOBIL\\nB.TEMPORARY\\nMOBIL USER\\nThe users have a purpose that requires some degree of mooility. Having\\na generator that is portable or semi-portable is a necessity to meet their\\nneeds. Customers havin g+ \\'.his type of need we classify as MOBIL Users.\\nTEMPORARY USER\\nRequiring the need for a generator for short term or a nonpermanent\\nuse are classified as a TEMPOkARY user. The following examples will iden-\\ntify the temporary user:I\\nVII-31\\na^\\nIn a, hospital in Washington main substation failed and one of the two\\noutdated and poorly maintained generators also failed. Curtis supplied\\nsix truck loads of generators to split the hospital\\'s load in order for\\nrepair crews to rebuild a substation. Within six hours the hospital was\\nback to nearly full power.\\nA shipping company has eight refers to maintain for several days. To\\nextend the life of their individual refrigeration units, reduce fuel con-.\\nsumption, and service personnel requirements, a Rental Generator provided\\npower for all eight units.\\nAn industrial plant working seven days a week and several months\\nbehind on orders is told by the local utility that their power will be off\\nfor a day. It is nesessary to upgrade the power lines for a new plant,\\nfor another company, being constructed in the same area. The industrial\\nplant is faced with two days to stop the production line, one day lost for\\nthe outage, and three days to restart the production line. The utility\\nrented our generator with operators to supply the industrial plant. The\\nplant was down 24 minutes instead of 6 days.\\nTHE THIRD GROUP-BUYERS\\nThe third type of Rental users can be made up from either group. The\\nRental Program becomes a purchase plan to acquire needed equipment. Large\\ncorporations with tight controls on capital expenditures sometime force\\npurchasing agents into a rental purchase plan. Rentals begin as a short\\nterm item and may extend into a long term purchase transaction.\\nDepending on the time frame and the dollar amount of the rental, a\\nuser in either the Mobil or Temporary group can move into the third group-\\nBuyers.\\nThe followiny outline the Mobil and Temporary applications with\\nexamples of each type.\\nVII-32\\nMOBIL APPLICATIONS:\\nFIRE DEPARTMENTS Pumpers, Lift Buckets, Rescue units, Ambulances\\nPOLICE DEPARTMENTS Communications \\tVans,\\tCrime\\tPrevention \\tUnits,\\nAviation Control Units.\\nMEDICAL SERVICES Emergency \\tCare\\tUnits,\\tMobil\\tX-Ray\\tand\\tDental\\nCenters, Prevention Screening Vans, \\tVeterinary\\nServices.\\nUTILITY Aerial\\tLift\\tTrucks,\\tMunicipal \\tSewer\\tInspection,\\nUnderground Air Ventalization.\\nTRANSPORTATION Truck Refrigeration, \\tPumps\\tfor Compressed Gases,\\nContainerized Refrigeration.\\nMOBIL SERVICES Beauty Palors, Animal Care Units,Training Centers,\\nIce Cream and Snowball Vendors, Book-Mobiles.\\nDISPLAYS Computer and Copier Display Vans, New Product Demo\\nUnits, Sales Centers, Floats.\\nNEWS MEDIA Mini-Cams, \\tControl/Tape \\tCenters,\\tRemote\\tProduc-\\ntions.\\nRECREATIONAL Campers, Motor Homes, Boating.\\nTEMPORARY APPLICATIONS:\\nCONSTRUCTION Subway,\\tPumps, Welding, Tools, Fans, Heaters, Pipe\\nFusing, Insulation Services.a\\nVII-33\\nELECTRICAL SERVICE \\tHospitals, Office Buildings, Plants, Stores,\\nWarehouses, Railroads, Model Homes.\\nSHIP SERVICE \\t Prime Power, Loading & Unloading, Construction,\\nDredging, Dry-Dock.\\nPUBLIC EVENTS \\t Fairs,\\tCarnivals, \\tShows,\\tConcerts, \\tSporting\\nEvents, Church Events.\\na\\nTESTING\\t Environmental and Industrial Testing, Natural\\nResources Drilling, (Off Shore Drilling).\\nAGRICULTURAL \\t Florists, Nurserymen, Dairymen, Poultrymen, etc.\\nLIGHTING\\t Construction, Stage, Security, Special Events,\\nSporting Events.\\nRental Generator range is from 2500 watts up to 1 megawatt. Approxi-\\nmately E0% of the normal rentals fall in the 15 kilowatt to 200 kilowatt\\nrange.\\nTo best meet the rental customer needs, the configurations of the\\nunits are as follows:\\n2 112 to 5 kilowatt are portable units with hand carrying frames, 120 or\\n120-240 volts, single phase with standard outlets. Most units are gasoline\\npowered.

Nationally there are\\nestimated to be 3000 generators, 15 kilowatt or larger in the rental mar-\\nket. We refer to an active market of generators specifically allocated for\\nrental applications. There are many generator sales organizations that\\nwill place a new unit on rental for a long term rental (6 months or\\nlonger). After the rental is terminated, the unit is sold as a used\\ngenerAtor.\\nThe Rental Power Business today is very competitive in some areas of\\nthe country, and nonexistent in other areas.\\nTo meet the needs of the entire market or a large portion of it, one\\nmust maintain a large balanced inventory. To meet customer\\'s needs our\\nrental fleet comprise over 150 units, 60% of the Baltimore-Washington\\nMarket\\'s inventory of Rental Power.\\nThe Rental Power Business can be profitable. One must rent their\\nequipment nearly 70% of the time to achieve a return on investment within\\ntwo to three years. To justify a multi-million dollar inventory the\\nbalance of unit sizes and -rentability must be matched.\\nOver the past thirty years we have learned what specifications ani\\ndesign to build or buy for the Rental Market. We start with a base gene-\\nrator, add mufflers, breakers, quick change voltage switch, fuel tank,\\nnperating instructions, skid base. Selecting the unit with the right\\nengine model, air cleaning and fuel filtering system is a must to protect\\nthe investment in a Rental Fleet.\\nVII-35\\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Solar\\nOver the past several months we have had some degree of diesel fuel\\nsupply problems. We have not lost a Rental due to this problem but it is a\\nserious concern for a customer and potential customer.\\nFrom a logistic standpoint of supplying fuel and fuel tanks, :% solar\\nsystem would reduce or eliminate this problem. There would be no need for\\nlarge tanks or refueling problems at job site. The safety problE:m of\\nstorage of flammable fuels would not be eliminated. Ninety-five percent of\\nservice problems with Rental Generators are with the engine drive end of\\nthe generator set.\\nEnvironmental problems of noise and exhaust pollution would be elimi-\\nnated. Today\\'s technologies are working toward greater efficiency of\\nengine powered systems. Work is done daily to reduce noise and air\\npollution.\\nTo deploy and operate a 15-20 kilowatt solar system with a 30 foot\\ndiameter collector would be impossible for some locations and difficult in\\nother locations. This size unit would not conform with space requirements\\nand some site requirements. At other sites to give access to direct sun\\nlight, the unit may be placed at a distant location. The distant location\\nwould require a larger solar system to compensate for voltage drop. This\\nsame problem occurs in engine powered generators if the unit is located\\nclose to the consumption point.\\nA solar unit would require a high degree of fool-proofing and vandal-\\nproofing, like an engine powered unit. This requirement would be needed to\\nprotect the safety of operators, equipment, and surroundings.\\nA multi-fuel system would be the best marketing tool to introduce the\\nsolar system. The user would have the advantages of solar and the piece-\\nof-mind that the backup system would supply his needs. Once solar tech-\\nnology reaches a point of acceptance as a total source the single solar\\nsystem would be acceptable. The solar unit would be lighter, less costly\\nto maintain, more maneuverable, and overall less costly.\\nVII-36\\na\\n\"\\t The following questions were directud to and answered by Mr. Vernon Waugh,\\n{\\t Curtis Engine, and Equipment, Inc.:\\n^. \"There is a problem associated with the use of solar systems as back-\\nup or reserve power systems concerning cost effectiveness and power\\nstorage. Obviously it is cheaper to have a diesel system than a solar\\nsystem waiting in reserve since solar becomes cost effective with use.\\nIf solar were to be used in a rental capacity, would the use factor be\\ngreat enough to make that application feasible?\"\\nA. \"For an application where the unit remains unused in a purely back-up\\nposition the cost would make a solar system prohibitive. Seventy\\npercent of my rental equipment is actually used however. So if a\\nmodular system existed that could be plugged into conventional equip-\\nment to operate as main or auxilary power, it would probably be a\\ngood, marketable product. We would be willing to buy and rent such\\nsystems.\"\\nQ.\\tWhat is the lifetime of a typical generating system being used now?\"\\nA. \"A piece of equipment is kept on the rental fleet for 2 to 3 years\\ndepending on its size and application. It is then sold as used equip-\\nment.\"\\nQ. \"Whereas the military has to plan for X years to implement technology,\\nif a useable system became available on the market in the near future,\\ncan you foresee purchasing this equipment as soon as it is available?\"\\nA.\\t\"Yes, and this certainly should be considered realizing that the lead\\ntime for generators from most manufacturers is roughly 4 to 7 months.\"\\nVII-37\\nQ. \"If the opportunity existed for you as a private businessman to enter\\ninto some type of cost sharing demonstration with the government with\\nthe type of equipment discussed here, would you be williig to try such\\na program?\"\\nA.\\t\"I would imagine that it would be advantageous for us to try such an\\nendeavor. It would be a step forward, and this would fit into our \\t g`\\ngoal of being a regional leader in the business.\"\\nComment\\n\"From all discussion concerning mobile power, it seems apparent that\\nan excellent market exists for solar concentrators with multifuel engines.\\nThere is probably a larger market for the engine than for the collector\\nmodule. Perhaps if the engines open the market, it will be much easier and\\ncheaper for solar to enter.\"\\nQ.\\t\"Could an estimate be given concerning the lead time before this\\ntechnology became a significant part of your inventory?\"\\nA. \"This would depend on cost and efficiency. As an estimate, over a 5\\nto 10 year period approximately 50 percent of the rental fleet could\\nbe converted.\"\\nComment\\n\"This is a good point to note that the time frame which must be anti-\\ncipated for success in any manner is 5 to 10 years. This type of techn-\\nology, though available, may not emerge overnight for reasons of testing,\\ntraining, etc.\"\\nQ.\\t\"When a customer rents state-of-the-art generating equipment, what is\\nthe cost to him for the power generated?\"m\\nVII-38\\n16\\nA. \"For current rental equipment, the cost per kilowatt is roughly three\\ntimes that of commercial electricity in the Baltimore/Washington\\narea.\"\\nQ.\\t\\n\\t\"If a generating unit is bought and then the cost written off taxes,\\nhow do the same rates compare?\"\\nA.\\t\\n\\t\"It is still more expensive by about 25 percent. This is size sen-\\nsitive and applies to below 250KW units.\"\\nQ. \"How would utilities respond to industries \\'peak shaving\\' by various\\nonsite generating equipment or systems, perhaps with existing backup\\nsystems?\"\\nA. \"I am not quite sure of the legal details involved nor of how the\\nutilities would respond to this. There is a law in existence now\\nwhich requires utilities to buy back any surplus of power (being\\nproduced by independent systems) at 3/4 of their selling rate. This\\nis to alleviate the production demand. It should be stressed that we\\nhave not become involved with the details of the law, we only know\\nthat it exists. An actual case that we are dealing with, where a\\nhospital is producing steam and electricity on an independent basis,\\nhas shown a complete payback period of seven years.\"\\nComment\\n\"A true cogeneration system running 7 days a week, 24 hours per day,\\ncan be paid off almost anywhere in the U.S. in two years, virtually every-\\nwhere in three years. In New York, it can be paid off in one year. The\\ndegree of cooperation from the utilities varies from coast to coast. For\\nexample, in California the utilities will do all in their power to support\\ninstallation of cogeneration units. Conversely, Consolidated Edison of New\\nYork will desperately try to prevent such installations. For years, the\\nindependent generation of any electricity in VEPCO was legally prohibited.\\nNow that law has been removed.\\nVII-39\\n\"California has recently made some progressive changes. California\\nutilities will buy energy from independent producers, then sell electricity\\nback at a lower rate. Currently PG&E will buy electricity at $83.00 per KW\\nper year. Additionally they will pay between 38 mils and 50 mils depending\\non time of day and time of year. The same energy is resold at an average\\nof $40.00 per KW. The rationale is that they are paying for the incre-\\nmental or marginal cost. Since most generatinn capacity was installed in\\nthis country at $150.00 to $250.00 per KW. Incremental power, considering\\nactual power cost, deferred cost, and interest on investment, is being put\\nin at $1500.. _) $2000.00 per KW. Hence, the incremental power is what is\\nbeing replaced, and the utilities must sell to all users at a consistent\\nrate.\"\\n\"President Carter, in a published program, has said he would pass\\nlegislation that would force other utilities to do the same.\"\\nQ. \"Concerning the private household rental and sales morket, is there a\\nsubstantial group of the population with large amounts of disposable\\nincome that would be willing to buy systems to become independent (off\\nthe grid)? This question seems reasonable due to the current Ameri-\\ncan attitude of independence and self-sustenance.\"\\nA. \"This has happened already in the Baltimore area where a person bought\\na system for his private business application, and his residence was\\nin the same building. In most cases now, the systems cannot be cost\\neffective enough to provide the necessary incentive. However, it only\\nseems reasonable that as systems do become more cost effective this\\nwill occur.\"\\nComment\\n\"It is interesting to learn from these discussions that an engine\\nwhich could be derated without loss of efficiency would be quite applicable\\nin many generating capacities. It should be pointed out that this is the\\nthrust of the new recuperated engines that are coming out now.\"\\nJ\\nt\\nVII-40\\nK-;\\nREVIEW OF CURRENTt\\nI\\nt.\\nI\\nI:\\nAPPLICATIONS EXPERIMENTS\\nTHE SMALL COMMUNITY\\nSOLAR THERMAL POWER EXPERIMENT\\nTARAS KICENIUK, EXPERIMENT MANAGER\\nJET PROPULSION LABORATORY\\nPASADEWA, CALIFORNIA\\nVIII-1\\nk\\nThe Department of Energy (DOE), through its Division of Central Solar\\nTechnology, is engaged in an effort to develop the technology for the\\npractical and economic collection and conversion of sunlight into electri-\\ncity.

The non-ideal\\nR\\treflective characteristics of the concentrator and re-radiation of energy\\nof the receiver are the principal causes of energy loss from these systems.\\nThe solar energy absorbed by the working fluid circulated through the\\nreceiver can be used directly as industrial or process heat, or the energy\\ncan be used to drive a heat engine allowing conversion to mechanical or\\nelectrical power. Brayton, Rankine or Stirling cycle machines can be\\nI\\nemployed, and conversion to electric power accomplished by the inclusion of\\nan alternator in the package.\\nVIII-28\\nVi I I -2^+\\nPFDR technology, by employing two-axis tracking and high concentration\\nratios, can achieve high conversion efficiencies. The energy collected can\\nbe converted to serve thermal or electric loads. Split fields are feasible\\nif a combination thermal and electric load is served.\\nPFDR technology offers all the advantages of a modular system. Inter-\\nchangeability and mass producibility of components are advantages which can\\nreduce the lifetime cost of ownership of these systems.

Richard Levin,\\nJPL:\\nQ.\\t\"The tracking and drive systems have not been mentioned. Are they\\nincluded in the RFPs or experiments?\"\\nA. \"Our technology project is developing the components. For example,\\nthe tracking controls and drive mechanisms are considered to be part\\nof the concentrator. The receiver will be built by a separate cor-\\nporation.\"\\nQ.\\t\"Are both EE1 and EE2a going to use the GE concentrator?\"\\nA,\\t\"Yes, it appears to have the lowest cost and greatest performance\\npayoff.\"\\nQ.\\t\"What is the cost of this pro;;ect?\"\\nA.\\t\"The total experiment (EE2) from beginning to end will cost about five\\nmillion dollars.\"\\nComment\\n\"The multi-fuel capacity of these systems has many merits. Perhaps\\none application that should be explored is the use of these systems in\\nareas where insolation is not very great, or where alternate fuel (biomass,\\nfossil fuel, etc.) is cheap and readily available. When sunlight is avail-\\nable it, of course, can be utilized. Yet by having some other fuel as the\\nprimary source, the problem of electrical storage is eliminated. Perhaps\\nit would be wise, therefore, to conduct one of these experiments in an area\\nwhere these conditions exist.\"\\n:\\'III-49\\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT fI:\"-=ED\\nt\\nResponse\\n\"This proposal is indeed creditable, yet them are certain problem\\nareas that must be dealt with. The main problem would be in combusting\\nsolid fuels. As the system is now, liquid fuels are easily piped tc the\\ncombuster unit. To handle solid fuels, the combuster would have to be\\nrelocated, or other measures taken to feed heat to the unit.\"\\nComment\\n\"The current engine design is only capable of burning liquid fuels or\\nnatural gas. An additional heat exchanger is needed to utilize solid\\nfuels. This would increase cost and weight and would decrease efficiency.\\nLater, modifications are planned to include solid fuel capability.\"\\nQ.\\t\"Six experiments have been listed yet only two described. Is this due\\nto lack of funds?\"\\nA. \"The experiments are operating on a nominal schedule, but there is\\nanother reason for this. The experiments are not all starting at the\\nsame time so that experience learned from the first ones can be\\napplied to later experiments. In this manner, the last experiments\\nwill be much more sophisticated and efficient, leading to a higher\\npayoff.\"\\nQ.\\t\"Will the initial RFP be for selecting the sites for all six experi-\\nments?\"\\nA.\\t\"At least two RFPs are expected. In the case of the navy experiment,\\nthe site is already determined, so no RFP is necessary.\"\\nQ. \"Have engineering studies determined the loss in efficiency brought\\nabout by placing the engine at some point on the collector other than\\nat the focal point?\"\\nVIII-50\\n,\\nA.\\t\"Actual experimental calculations have not been done, but the overall\\nrancepts have been considered.\"\\nComment\\n\"Some studies have been done concerning the changes mentioned. There\\nis little advantage gained by reducing the structural weight at the focal\\npoint even by a factor of two. Most of the critical loading on the dish\\nitself concerns the overturning moment of the Mind load. Relocating the\\nengine will not decrease the cost per square meter of the concentrator by\\nan appreciable amount. Since the working fluid is at extremely high\\ntemperatures, the tradeoffs involved seem to make engine relocation in\\nunwise decision.\"\\nQ.\\t\"How many dishes will be used in this experiment?\"\\nA. \"There will be six dishes for a total of 100KW in the first experi-\\nment. This will not be enough to determine actual manufacturing\\ncosts, to answer another question. These are purely engineering\\nexperiments, \\tnot commercialization or manufacturing analyses.\\nProduction costing is being done, but it is independent.\"\\nVIII-51\\nZ\\nIMPLEMENTATION\\nDOD PROJECT MANAGER-\\nMOBILE ELECTRIC POWER\\nCOL A.

Another problem is that per-\\nspective customers are skeptical because the U.S. is not using the\\ntechnology.\"\\ntnLCEDING PAGE BLANK. NOT PILAW\\nIX-55\\ni\\n\"THE ROLE OF CONGRESS\"\\nSenator Pete V. Domenici (R-NM)\\nGood morning! When I accepted your invitation to speak at your solar\\nworkshop, I had no idea I would be getting up with the sun to be here.\\nAs I understand it, you have been spending several days talking about\\nsolar thermal electric technologies from the standpoint of what the users\\nof these technologies need and what the producers have to offer. The\\nusers, in this case, are different groups within the Federal Government;\\nand as such, I would like to speak with you about the role of Congress in\\npromoting and encouraging this \"market\" activity. After all, who holds the\\npurse strings?\\nGenerally speaking, you could charactErize solar power as the apple\\npie issue of the Congress\\' eye. There are very few Congressmen who would\\nvote against a piece of solar legislation on the floor of the House or\\nSenate where they are truly under the scrutiny of their constituencies.\\nThis would lead you to believe that any solar bill introduced in the Con-\\ngress was bound to pass. Why, you might expect the Washington Monument to\\nbe covered with solar cells if it were not for the crucial role that Con-\\ngressional Committees play in molding such legislation. Committees such as\\nthe Senate Energy Committee, the House Commerce Committee, and th q House\\nScience ano Technology Committee have the job of doing the substantive work\\nand real analyses that go into good solar legislation.\\nA question that frequently comes to my mind in the hearings we hold in\\nthe Energy Committee is: Why do we need this legislation? That may sound\\nlike an obvious question with an equally obvious answer; but, in making\\npublic policy decisions on what incentives we are to provide for solar\\ndevelopment, we have to craft the legislative remedy for the specific\\nconstraint to solar use. These constraints are many, and they are often\\nnot simply overcome.\\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\\tIX-57\\n^e\\nThey include:\\nEconomic Constraints\\n1.\\tHigh initial capital costs\\n2.\\tLong payback on investment\\n3.\\tRisk of consumer indifference\\nInstitutional Constraints\\n1.\\tLending institutions (FNMA and GNMA)\\n2.\\tProhibitive utility rate structures\\nRegulatory and Legal Constraints\\n1.\\t4o right to sunlight\\n2.\\tHigher property taxes due to solar equipment result-_R\\n_p\\ning in longer payback\\nThe incentives to overcome these constraints are many and, as I will\\ndescribe, sometimes appear to have little to do with a specific constraint. -\\nI should also note that the Federal Government is not alone in its desires\\nto promote solar use. \\tSince\\t1974,\\t22 states \\thave passed \\tlaws exempting\\nsolar\\tequipment \\tfrom\\tsales\\ttaxes.\\tAnother\\t27\\tstates\\thave\\tlowered\\tthe\\nproperty taxes on solar equipment. \\tSeveral states like my own, New Mexico,\\nsupport solar R&D and encourage the development of solar industries.\\nAt the Federal \\tlevel, a number cf steps have been taken to assure the\\nconsuming public that this \\tdeveloping industry \\tis an honest one. \\tLegis-\\nlation calling \\tfor performance standards and certification procedures has\\nbeen passed and a number of direct economic incentives were included in The\\nNational Energy Act such as:\\n1.\\tAn income tax credit for solar equipment\\n2.\\tLikewise, a business tax credit\\n3.\\tLoan support for heating and cooling equipment\\n4.\\t$100 million for solar devices \\tin `zi\\t1-jildings\\n5.\\t$98 million for federal purchase r \\t itaic cells\\nThese last two provisions of The Nationa: \\t Act may seem somewhat\\nunusual if our goal was to promote the use of solar in the private sector,\\nbut they were designed to do just that.\\nIX-58\\ni\\nNot only was the tool of federal procurement used to foster widespread\\ndemonstration of the utility of these different solar technologies, but\\nthese prog^ams were a way to promote the industries. In the instance of\\nthe phct;:,voltaic procurement, the goal was to promote the industry and,\\ntherefore, lower the cost of the technology by bringing the industry along\\nits \"earning curve.\" This program\\'s intent may appear to be obvious to\\nyou and most virtuous at the same time. Remember though that similar\\napproaches had never been pursued to benefit the civilian population. The\\nDefense Procurement Act was designed to promote certain industries vital to\\nthe National Defense, not industries vital to the consuming citizen.\\nThe idea of federal procurement of solar technologies goes to the\\nheart of what you must have been discussing over the past few days. I :m\\nsure for the industry representatives the question of whether this \"tool\"\\nwill be used in the future must be an important one.\\nIn this regard, I must discuss with you some of the different philos-\\nophies I see expressed on the Energy Committee as we work on solar legisla-\\ntion.\\nThere are those Senators who believe that the marketplace should be\\nallowed to work and the Federal Government has no tole in the promotion of\\nthe solar industry. Those Senators are a small minority; and. as time goes\\non, they would appear to be growing smaller as we gradually realize that\\nthe development cf alternative energy sour-Les is in the national interest.\\nOther Senators believe R&D is as far as we should go in the promotion\\nof solar energy by the Fedeti ,al Government. Obviously, support of this new\\nindustry by cost effective federal procurement goes beyond this and even\\nbeyond simple demonstration programs. The key to the acceptance of this\\nstrategy has been that the procurement is on a \"cost effective basis.\"\\nBecause of this, and the realization by many Congressmen that solar tech-\\nnologies have wide applications even under this constraint. I believe you\\nWill find further encouragement of federal procurement in the solar area.\\nIX-59\\na\\nThe following questions were directed to and answered by Senator Peter\\nDomenici, (R-NM;:\\nComment\\n\"One problem that has been seen in the DOD market is that Senator\\nHart\\'s legislation allowed for a life cycle cost benefit that was really\\ndefinable. This is not solar\\'s position. In order to come close to having\\na life cycle break even point, a lot of hand waving has to be done. New\\nlegislation should allow for some latitude.\"\\nResponse\\n\"If experts can make it clear that the latitude can produce positive\\npotential for getting away from this barrier, I am supportive of that\\nlatitude. If this cannot be displayed to the committees, there will indeed\\nbe difficulties.\"\\nQ. \"There is a very interesting relationship between the synthetic fuels\\nprogram and this technology. Congress is planning to spend 30 to 40\\nbillion dollars in synthetic fuel development in order to save 2\\nmillion barrels of oil which we could simply stop using by other\\nmeasures. why, if Congress is willing to spend that amount of money\\nin synthetic fuels, will they not spend the same kind of money for\\nsolar development? There is a lot more potential for solar.\"\\nA. \"As a supporter of synthetic fuel spending, perhaps I can respond\\nacceptably. I see the spending as an investment rather than as a use\\nof tax dollars. For example, I am convinced that if we move ahead\\nwith flexible authority to guarantee loans, to set prices one is\\nwilling to pay, and to guarantee purchases in three or four synthetic\\ntechnologies, that we will not pay one cent of tax dollars when these\\nthings come on board. If prices are set now, by the ti; r^ plants are\\nup, oil wilt be so expensive that synthetics will be commercial and\\nIX-61\\nPRECEDIN G PAGE pL.AIvK NOT FILMED\\nk\\nthe guarantee wi 11 not be used. I see no way for the U.S. to remove\\nitself from dependence on huge quantities of crude oil from now to\\naround the year 2010 or 2020. Nor are we going to be able to produce\\nsufficient quantities of crude. The deficiencies will be met by\\nimporting, or by production of synthetic fuels. America can progress\\nin conservation and in alternate energy, but we must face a signifi-\\ncant dependence on crude oil for a few generations to come.\"\\nQ. \"In the course of this workshop a large number of good, potential\\napplications for solar thermal technology have been defined. Some of\\nthe problems associated with the technology are that it is still in\\ndevelopment, and that it is so very flexible. In contrast to photo-\\nvoltaics where actual units are physically functioning in well defined\\napplications, solar thermal technology is still in flux and the spec-\\ntrum of possible applications is wide. At this stage the final con-\\nfiguration is not one, but many. This makes it difficult for\\ndevelopers to present to implementors specific packages or goals.\\nWhat practical steps can be taken by developers of solar thermal\\ntechnology to advise and communicate to implementors the ideas and\\ndirections that appear practical?\"\\nA. \"Congress cannot explicitly concern itself with the technical aspects\\nof development. The fact that the technology is so diverse makes it\\ndifficult for persons with less than broad authority to implement it.\\nHence, what must be done is to work with persons \\'on the hill\\' who\\nhave legislative talents. Perhaps the best suggestion is to confront\\nlegislative draftsmen with your proposals, and work the procurement\\nissue from there.\"\\nQ. \"Do you feel that Congress is willing to pass fairly explicit solar\\ntax shelter legislation; and is Congress able to engage in aggressive\\noversight of the implementation- of programs which they pass in con-\\njunction with DOE?\"AM\\nIX-62\\t\\ni\\nA. \"Although I do not consider myself an expert in the field of taxes, I\\ndo think a willingness exists in Congress to consider such legis-\\nlation.

Unquestionably,\\nDOE is doing a poor job of overseeing programs, and Congress is doing\\na worse job in watching DOE. Hopefully this can change.\"\\nQ.\\t\"Is there any current legislation concerning loan guarantees for\\nutilities since they represent a large possible market?\"\\nA. \"No such legislation exists to the best of my knowledge. However,\\nthere is a lot of other legislation being passed around concerning\\nsolar. In addition to trying to pass a synthetic fuel package within\\nthe next year (governmental prrmotion), Congress will not likely pass\\na major solar bank proposal. This will be a source of Federally\\ninsured loans at a subsidized rate available to users of new solar\\ntechnology.

Would any particular applica-\\ntion be preferable?\\nProbably not--see discussion summary.\\nX-16\\ni 8. What action would be necessary to elicit a decision by corporate\\nmanufacturers to invest in production of a solar thermal electric\\npower system for remote applications?\\nDOE should announce that one to five installations per month will be\\nmade for the next five years. Typical applications would be post\\noffices, federal buildings, etc. DOE would decide on the type of\\nsystem to be installed in each, i.e., point focus Rankine, point focus\\nBrayton, point focus Stirling, line focus Rankine, etc. Contract\\naward would go to a low bidder. Manufacturers would retain rights and\\ndata and would know that there would be a continuing market for pilot\\nproduction.\\nX-17\\nThere exists substantial confusion regarding the role of U.S. govern-\\nment programs in the development of solar thermal power. The attendees\\nperceived a desire on the part of some factions of DOE to make technical\\nchoices (photovoltaics vs. solar thermal, central power vs. distributed \\t6\\ngeneration, etc.) between technologies. Such choices are unwise for two\\nreasons. First, it is too early in development to make such choices--hard\\nexperimental results are not yet available. Second, it is not a government\\nfunction to make such choices. These are made best in the marketplace.\\nThe proper function of government programs is to develop technical options\\nand stimulate those technologies offering promise for the future. At this\\npoint, DOE has the luxury of being able to develop multiple technical\\noptions. That luxury should be exploited and used to maximum advantage in\\ndeveloping a range of options to meet the nation\\'s energy needs.\\nThe chief impediment to accelerated experiment deployment is the high\\ncost of capita l equipment. An accelerated schedule for experiment deploy-\\nment is urgently needed, especially for isolated load experiments. Legis-\\nlative incentives, tax credits, accelerated depreciation etc., are more\\nsuitable incentives as production capabilities improve and the technology\\nmatures.\\nOnce the experiments have been completed and the results analyzed,\\nusers will be able to select the most appropriate system from a variety of\\nchoices. In this regard, military demonstrations, by themselves, are not\\nsufficient.\\nNo hardware, regardless of the attractiveness of an incentives pro-\\ngram, however, will be successful unless a cost effective application is\\navailable. The deployment program, must be very careful, therefore, to\\nproceed with a full understanding of the market and its structure.\\nX-18\\nC\\nPOLICY\\nDOE\\nACCELERATED\\t\\nINDUSTRIAL\\t\\nLEGISLATIVE\\nEXPERIMENTS\\t\\nINNOVATION\\t\\nINCENTIVES\\nEARLY\\tI\\t STIMULATED\\nMARKETS\\t I PRODUCTION\\nCOMMERCIALIZATION\\nISOLATED POWER SYSTEMS\\nX-19\\nDECREASED VULNERABILITY (FEWER FUEL\\nLOGISTIC PROBLEMS)\\nLOWER LIFE CYCLE COSTS\\n(INCREASED CAPABILITY)\\nX-20\\nI\\t\\nPROBLEMS\\n-\\tU.S. GOVERNMENT (DOE) STRATEGY\\nA)PREMATURE CHOICES\\nB)SLOW EXPERIMENT DEPLOYMENT\\n-\\tCOSTS\\nA)HIGH CAPITAL COST\\nB)UNCERTAIN LIFE CYCLE COST\\nX-21\\nWORKING GROUP II\\nISOLATED POWER SYSTEMS\\nNAME ORGANIZATION TELEPHONE\\nJ.\\tC.\\tBelote BDM Corporation (703)821-5063\\nDean Scribner U.S. Coast Guard (703)426-1050\\nOffice of Energy\\nJeffrey T.

Civil applications discussed were almost entirely indus-\\ntrial as opposed to other commercial-type or residential applications such\\nas housing developments, hospitals, supermarkets, etc. The discussion of\\nmilitary applications did encompass these other applications from the point\\nof view that :they are \"duplicated\" on a military installation.\\nThe group reached a strong consensus in formulating two major recom-\\nmendations: (1) that solar thermal electric technologies need an FPUP-type\\nprogram, and (2) the Department of Energy must develop a long-range plan\\nfor commercialization of PFDR systems.\\nA FPUP-type program is needed to a:tablish a strong commitment by the\\ngovernment to pursue solar thermal electric systems. This emphasis, as\\nshown by infusion of substantial dollars ($100 million), will provide a\\nclear incentive to system manufacturers to begin pianning for production,\\ncapacities; that can support the market growth required to meet stated\\nfederal alternative energy goals. A second essential characteristic of an\\nFPUP-type program fo military applications is that the \"blanket check\"\\naspect allows the services to purchase hardware without going through\\nnormal procurement policies and channels. This point addresses a strong\\narea of concern for military applications. Military representatives\\nbelieve that present institutional barriers must be relaxed if solar ther-\\nmal electric systems are to be purchased by th,6 , services. Conflicting\\nlegislation, military regulations, and OMB life-cycle costing procedures\\nall work against the introduction into the military of alternate energy\\nsystems. The FPUP-type approach provides a conven ient method of circum-\\nventing these \"roadblocks\" by allowing ystem hardware purchases under\\nResearch and Development funding.\\nThe recommendation for a long-term alternate technology commerciali-\\nzation plan developed from recognition by the group membership that energy\\nshortfalls are resulting in a growing awarene •.^s that alternate energy\\nsources must be found. Pressures are being applied to both the military\\nX-29\\nand industry to reduce energy consumption and replace fossil-fuel derived\\nenergy with renewable forms. The origins for this pressure extend from\\nfederally mandated goals on the military side to notification by utilities\\nof future inability to meet current electricity/fuel demands on the indus-\\ntrial side. Both groups are under management pressure to reduce escalating\\nenergy costs.\\nGroup members believed that it is not clear which alternate tech-\\nnologies provide the most promise for accomplishing what is required to\\nreduce these pressures. A federally approved plan that clearly identifies\\nalternate energy technologies, funding levels, development phases and\\ntimetables, and decision points for system commercialization is necessary\\nto provide input to long-term (5 to 7 years) investment and planning\\ncycles.\\nAdditional Military Applications Concerns\\nThe group believes thaw. the best military application is for base\\nfacilities as contrasted with remote sites or portable systems. The base\\t\\nfacilities applications parallel civilian applications in that military \\t -\\nbases can be considered as \"small communities.\" If military applications\\nare used for solar thermal electric system demonstrations, the group cau-\\ntioned against the possibility of the general public not believing in a\\ndirect applicability to the civil sector. This results from the perceived\\ntendency for the military to require stringent specifications and not be as\\ndemanding of a favorable cost/benefit ratio.\\nThe military representatives expressed the opinion that personnel\\ntraining and education programs are required to establish maintenance\\nprocedures and proficiency, and in a broader context, to promote overall\\nawareness of solar thermal electric benefits. With regard to maintenance\\nprocedures, the military generally requires a substantial operations and\\nmaintenance data base to justify hardware specifications for system pro-\\ncurement. The magnitude of this data base usually requires data collection\\nfrom 10 to 15 systems in operation for up to 5 years.\\t\\nAnother military concern expressed dealt with power interface re- \\t i\\nquirements for specific applications. A suggestion was made that as a\\nX-30\\ngiven alternate energy technology develops, a cross-feed be established\\nwith user energy needs. In this manner, the energy system design and the\\nuser requirements can be optimized through a well-thought-out and timely\\n3\\tinterface definition.\\nAdditional Civil Applications Concerns\\nAs mentioned previously, civil applications centered almost\\nexclusively on industrial applications. Group industry representatives\\nbelieved that some form of government incentives were required to insure\\ndevelopment of a strong solar thermal electric market; both for the tech-\\nnology systems manufacturers and the potential consumers. Conclusions were\\nnot reached as to the exact form for the incentives to take (depreciation\\nallowance, short-term payback, return-on investment, cost sharing, etc.).\\nThe preferred form appears to be industry and accounting procedure speci-\\nfic.\\nA point was made that emphasis should be placed on factory construc-\\ntion for solar thermal electric systems. On-site construction costs can be\\na factor of two to four times higher than factory construction. Inherent in\\nthis recommendation is support for modularity since this would increase the\\nutility of the product manufactured.\\nGroup discussion addressed the area of centralized versus distributed\\nsystems. This issue is not only ap plication specific (decentralized\\nplants, land availability, etc.) but also dependent on the required energy\\nform; e.g., electricity is relatively easy to distribute from a central\\ngenerator but low- or medium-Btu process heat is not.\\nA final general observation was made by the industry representatives\\nthat industrial equipment is wearing out in many areas of this country.\\nThis could represent a \"solar opportunity\" as retrofit or replacement of\\ncurrent systems increases over the next 10 to 15 years.\\nGeneral Solar Thermal Electric Discussion\\nThe group believed that to meet specific military and civil energy\\nneeds the best attributes for solar thermal electric systems are system\\nX-31\\n6\\nversatility, external combustion heat engines, low temperature/high\\ntemperature operations, hybrid operations, and co-generation possibilities.\\nThe ability to provide both electricity and thermal energy is a definite\\nplus as is the ability to provide incremental additions to satisfy the\\nenergy demand of a given application.\\nX-32\\nIr\\nFACILITIES APPLICATION IS BEST MILITARY\\nOPPORTUNITY FOR PFDR,\\n-\\tPARALLEL CIVILIAN APPLICATIONS\\n-\\tBASES ARE \"SMALL CITIES\"\\n1\\t\"MIL SPEC & DAMN THE (AST\" SYNDROME\\n1\\tRELAXED PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS\\n-\\tCOMPETE WITH \"WALL PLUG\"\\nX-33\\nNi\\n1\\tVERSATILE: CAN UTILIZE RANKINE, BRAYTON, STIRLING.\\nLOW TEMP/HIGH TEMP\\n1\\tSUITABLE TO CO-GENERATION: CAN SATISFY THERMAL\\nAND ELECTRICAL NEEDS\\n1\\tSUITABLE TO HYBRID OPERATIONS\\n1\\tSUITABLE TO OPERATION WITH STORAGE\\nX-34\\nI\\tINCREMENTAL ADDITIONS TO CAPACITY, OR\\n•\\tWHERE TWO TIER APPLICATION EXISTS\\n-\\tELECTRIC POWER (HIGH QUALITY ENERGY)\\n-\\tTHERMAL ENERGY (LOW- MEDIUM QUALITY)\\n1\\tWHERE FIRM CAPACITY IS REQUIRED\\n1\\tINDUSTRIAL USE OF ELECTRICITY\\nINCREASING OR DECREASING?\\nX-35\\n13\\n1\\tMULTI-YEAR MILESTONE CHART\\n-\\tPERFORMANCE PROJECTIONS\\n-\\tCOST PROJECTIONS\\n-\\tEARLY EXPERIMENTS\\n-\\tDEMONSTRATIONS\\n1\\tTECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND POWER REQUIREMENTS\\nOF USERS PROCEED IN PARALLEL TO IDENTIFY INTER-\\nFACE REQUIREMENTS EARLY.\\nX-36\\n1\\tNEED GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES\\n-\\tDEPRECIATION\\n-\\tSHORT-TERM PAYBACK (ROI)\\nCOST SHARING\\n1\\tENCOURAGE FACTORY CONSTRUCTION\\n-\\tMODULARITY\\n-\\tMINIMIZE 011-SITE CONSTRUCTION\\n1\\tCENTRALIZED VS.

Private industry is not capable of doing it\\nalone.\\nB.\\tSpecificcific Suggestions\\n(1) If new legislation is necessary, the political problem concerning\\npassage of this legislation within Congress must be addressed.\\nIndustry probably shares this responsibility for supporting\\nlegislation and informing Congress concerning technical progress.\\n(1) On the non-legislative level, industry has public relations\\nresponsibility in conjunction with DOE.\\n(3)Position papers are needed.\\n(4)Industries must be prepared to exert political pressure\\nX-45\\nr,,, ,LLjING PAGE 6tAI,?( \"0i \"LWD\\n.im\\n(5)Procurement and patent barriers should be removed within DOE to\\nallow for proper program designs.\\n(6)Procurement plans should be multiyear and comptehensivs for\\ntechnical development and commercialization.\\n(7)Goals must be determined.\\nC.\\tSuggested New Legislation\\n(1)Small business needs the means and incentives for participation.\\n(2)State and local governments nead involvement as well as the \\t a\\nutilities.\\n(3)Legislation for oil displacement allowance is needed.\\n(4)Legislation is needed to involve DOD in the solar thermal pro-\\ngram.\\nD.\\tPossible Purchase Strategies\\n(1). Federal purchases in early years would aid technical development.\\n(2)Tax credits, mandatory service contracts, and government backed\\nwarranties would stimulate consumer use in the early stages.\\n(3)Government procurement could be accomplished through a savings\\npaid procurement program.\\nX-46\\nIn order to rapidly implement solar thermal technology w ithin the\\nr Department of Defense, it is necessary to utilize the expedited DOD budget\\nand procurement procedures. A supplemental program similar to the Federal\\nPhotovoltaic Utilization Program (FPUP) must be set up. A 10 to 12 year\\ndevelopment time frame must be assured and in this way the procurement of\\nsolar thermal technology can occur in half the normal 20-year time limit.\\nThis would allow the DOD engineers and scier%ists to collect the operating\\nand maintenance data on these systems necessary to establish their suit-\\n;\\t ability to meet DOD requirements, while providing a highly visible\\n\"showcase\" which will speed acceptance among personnel.\\nIt is not yet possible to use solar thermal technology in tactical\\nsituations. The defense mission capability must be maintained. Data on\\nthe reliability, availability, maintainability and dependability of solar\\nthermal equipment is necessary before these systems can be purchased under\\nnormal procurement procedure. Before the military institutes a new system\\nit must be shown that a significant increase in capability is required, is\\nachievable, and affordable. The multi-fuel aspect of solar thermal tech-\\nnology may fulfill that requirement and should be emphasized.\\nTo institute an FPUP-type program, Congressional action may not be\\nnecessary--an interagency agreement would suffice.\\nThe normal DOD procurement cycle requires operational and maintain-\\nability data before any system may be purchased. Statistically relevant\\ndata that the DOD has compiled are usually required, although DOD may\\naccept credible data produced by other labs.\\nThe resistance to change that exists everywhere in human nature is\\nalso present within the Department of Defense. In order for acceptance of\\nsolar thermal technology by society, education is necessary.\\nHuman nature can work in favor cf solar development if incentives\\naccompany the development and installation of solar equipment. For\\nexample, experience in California has shown that tax shelters and incen-\\ntives, if they are large enough, permit solar technology to be implemented\\nsolely for financial reasons.\\nX-47\\nGovernment involvement is necessary for the implementation of solar\\nthermal technology to occur at an accelerated pace. The market place\\ncannot do it alone. Loan guarantees and tax incentives have to exist.\\nIf a commitment to solar technology exists in this country, it should\\nbk c -it i nto wri ti ng, and both DOE and 000 shoul d be made aware of i t.\\nX-48\\ni\\n7}\\nBARRIERS\\n1\\tTIME FRAME ACCELERATION\\n1\\tCONGRESSIONAL POLITICS\\n1\\t\"SLOWNESS\" AT DOE\\n1\\tLACK OF USER INFORMATION\\n1\\tLACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE\\nWORK FORCE\\nFINANCING\\nSMALL BUSINESS (COMPETITION)\\nLEGAU REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY\\n1\\tSOCIAL AND DOD ACCEPTANCE MODELS\\n1\\tSUBSIDY OF OTHER FUELS\\nX-49\\nNEW LEGISLATION\\nDOD PROVISIONS\\nPROGRAM PLAN\\nDATA BASE DEVELOPMENT\\nFPUP ANALOGOUS (LIFE CYCLE COST IN 3-4 YEARS)\\nSMALL BUSINESS\\n-\\tMARKET SURVEY SUPPORT\\n1\\tGOVERNMENT STUDIES\\n1\\tINVOLVE STATE & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS\\n1\\tINVOLVE UTILITIES\\nTECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT\\nFUELS AND CHEMICALS\\nHYBRID CAPABILITIES\\nX-50\\nNON-LEGISLATIVE\\nr\\ni\\tINDUSTRYPUBLIC RELATIONS-\\tPOSITION PAPERt\\t -\\tPOLITICAL PRESSURE\\ni\\tDOE\\n-\\tPROGRAM PLAN\\n-\\tSTREAMLINE PROCUREMENT\\n-\\tCLEAR UP PATENT STATUS\\nX-51\\nm2a\\n1\\tA COMPREHENSIVE MULTI-YEAR PROGRAM PLAN FOR\\nDEVELOPMENT AK COMMERCIALIZATION OF SOLAR\\nTHERMAL TECHNOLOGIES MUST BE PRODUCED AND\\nAPPROVED,\\n1\\tKEY ELEMENTS\\n-\\tGOALS--RELATIVE TO NATIONAL GOALS\\n-\\tIDENTIFICATION OF MARKETS\\n-\\tSTRATEGY--STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH\\n-\\tPLAN FOR INDUSTRY/DOE/DOD, ETC.\\nINTERACTION\\n-\\tKEY RESPONSIBILITIES\\n-\\t\\'JCHEDULES/RESOURCES\\n1\\t6-MONTH SCHEDULE TO APPROVAL\\nX-52\\nNAME ORGANIZATION TELEPHONE\\nRobert Danziger JPL (213)577-9398\\nPick Nelson Acurex (415)964-3200\\nFred Manasse University of New Hampshire (603)862-2460\\nPete Ritzcoven Naval Materiel Command (202)692-1444\\nTom Kuehn JPL (213)577-9393\\nBlaine S. \\tPurcell Texas Tech. \\tUniv.

The use of printed \\nwax suggested several advantages over the presently used techniques in terms \\nof econom) and reduced process i ng tin*. In addition, removal of wax from \\nprocessed cel l s and its subsequent reuse afforded the possi bi l i ty of further \\neconomy along with the reduction of waste ma-terial output. \\nA study of four -2echniques (transfer, I i thography, intagl io and letterpress) \\nidenti f ied letterpress ~ri nti ng as having the fewest problems where app!.ied to - \\nsolar cell processing. The most overall suitable masking wax Identified was \\nan Apiezon W solution. The suitability of Apiezon W as a masking agent was \\ndemonstrated on bare silicon, and on silicon coated with sllicon dioxide and \\nwith si!icon nitride, both textured and planar. Various methods of wax removal \\nwere researched, with emphasis placed on a system that avoided the use \\nof organic solvents. Although renovat by boiling water or steam appeared promising, complete removal was not possible \\nby either of these methods. \\nThe net result of the project revealed that letterpress printing produced \\nless than satisfactory image qua!ity for use in solar cell processing, and that \\ncomplete removal of wax from processed wafers by means of water or steam \\nis not practical. \\na2.0 l NTROOUCT 1 ON \\nThe patterned conductors on st l icon sol at ce l t s may be f ncorporated I n* \\nthe process sequence in one of three ways: \\n1. Metal deposition on a bare sllicon surface \\n(a) Evaporate metal pattern\\' throu* a mask \\n(b) Si I t. screen meta I pattern \\n(c) Evaporate (or sputter) metal over the entire surface, and incorporate a separate patterning step. \\n. . \\n2. Metal deposition in a pattern on the dielectric (AR) layer, and reaction through the \\nAR layer ta contact the sf Iicon. \\n3. Metal deposition in patterns opened in a dielectric (AR) layer. Considering \\nthe long range DOE price projections, pethods 1 and 2 are considered to be \\ntoo expensive in terms of basic materials cost and/or processing cost. Method \\n3 can incorporate a simple and economical base metal \\nplating technology; it is necessary, however, that technology exist for \\nproviding the openings in the pre-applied dielectric (AR) coating In an \\neconom i ca l manner. \\nOne dielectric patterning technique, comnonly uced in the semiconductor industry, \\ninvclves photoresist. A photosensitive liquid, known as photoresist \\n(PR) , is applied to the cell surface by spraying or rapid spinning as a thin layer \\ncf controlled thickness. As the freshiy applied PR layer is viscous and sticky at this point, a baking step is performed to drive off residual \\nsolverit and produce \\na surface that permits further processing. After baking, the PR Layer is exposed to \\nUV light through a shadow mask, irradiating the layer in the intended pattern. The irradiation \\npr-omotes chemical reactions in the PR layer, causing the illuminated \\nareas to be either more or less soluble than the unilluminsted portions, depending \\non the type of PR used (positive or negative). The cells, after \\nan additional bake, are exposed to a solvent which selectively removes photoresist, leaving behind \\n8 PR pattern resembling that on the shadow mask. \\nThe rema!ning pattern is used to protect parts of the device from the etchant \\nagents that are employed to dissolve away the unmasked dielectric (e.g., silicon dioxide or nitride) layers. After \\netching, the PR must itself be removed by s \\nspecial stripping solution. The use of photoresist presents \\na number of problems. The material itself is expensive. Being light sensitive, \\nPR processing areas must be illuminated by yellow safety light and must also be carefully temperature- and humidity-controlled. The photographic process by which the \\nPR is patterned is time consuming, and calls for expensive exposure equipment and carefully prepared photographic glass plates bearing the intended pattern image (or its \\nphotogra2hic negative). More- over, the \\nPR mixtures available are non-reuseable. Once applied and processed, the \\nPR undergoes irreversible chemical aiteration and must be chemically destroyed in oraer to effect removal \\nfrom the cbbstrate surface. Other disadvantages are also encountered. \\nPR contains organic solvents, such as xylene, which are released to the atmosphere \\ndc.-ing use; some FR mixtures generate gas during storage, causing potentially dangerous pressure buildup; and virtually all have limited shelf life. \\nThe use of wax as a substitute for photoresist results in substantial benefits. \\nWax is generally less costly than carefully formulated PR preparations. Unlimited shelf life is possible, since wax, either \\nin pure solid form or as a mixture with an organic solvent, is relatively \\ninsensitive to temperature and does not depend for \\nits effectiveness on photochemical reactions. Even if solvent-wax mixtures are used \\ninstea0 of pure wax, the use of organic solvents to develop the image \\nis avoided, thereby lessening the amount of solvent released to the atmosphere. \\nProcessing tlme is slgnif lcantly reduced by avoiding the lengthy multiple baking cycles and exposure steps necessary with photoresist. \\nTo the above must be added the lack of \\na need for- a physlcally separate photoresist factllty \\nrequiring special illumlnatlor,, humidification, and temperature control. Since wax is not light-sensitlve, its use as a patterned masking agent requires \\na method of producing a pattern without the sxposure or develop1 ng processes involved with the use of photoresist. Any of various printing methods suggest themselves \\nas suitable for forming the requtred pattern. Silk- screen \\npri nt i ng has been successf u I I y employed for th i s purpose. Sl I k screen1 ng \\nrequires -rhe use of properly prepared formulations which have appropriate flow properties while maintaining useful etch resistance consistent with ease of removal. The purpose of this program was to investigate some \\nform of impact printing, using \\na printing device similar to an ordinary office stamp, which would provide benefits \\nof simplicity, coating durability, and speed over current silk-screen \\nmethods. \\nThe project entai led the performance of several tasks: \\n1) Determine the printing method \\n2) Determine a suitable wax resist \\n3 Text printing results and modify process if necessary \\n4) Evaluate methods of wax removal. \\n3.0 TECHNICAL DISCUSSION \\n3.1 TYPES OF PRINTING Four printing variations were studied: transfer printing, lithography, intaglio, and letterpress. \\n3.1.1 TRANSFER PRINTING \\nTransfer printing involves a process analogous to the use of carbon paper or \\na film typewriter ribbon. A thin, durable film carries upon it a \\nthin I yer of wax which is transferred to the solar cell substrate surface by \\npressure applied to the back of the film. If pressure is applied in a pattern: a patterned iayer of wax is transferred. \\nIt was suspected that this method of printing would be the least desirable; experimental results bore this out. \\nToo thick a wax coating on the transfer \\nfilm caused either failure to transfer or ragged line edges where the wax had torn away \\nfrom the supporting film. Thinner wax coatings improved edge definition but resulted in spotty wax coatings with pinholes \\nand relatively large areas of unmasked surface. In \\naddiiian, adhesion was found to be poor, with the thin wax coating lifting off the substrate during etching. \\nThis method \\nwas rejected. \\n3.1.2 1. I TtiOGRAHY \\nIn lithography, a flat surface is treated so that parts of it attract and hold \\na substance such as ink or wax, while other parts are repellant, The definition of attractive and repellant areas is achieved by \\na number of methods, such as application to \\nan area or the plate of a special grease, or plating srtain areas \\nwith a metal to which wax adheres, while the plate is composed of a repellant material. \\nThe preparation of lithographic plates proved to be both complicated and expensive. The use \\nof a grease pattern to define the wax-bearing areas of the plate was not practical \\nsince the grease image would wear off very qulckly In use \\nor suffer rapid image degradation due to the grease solvent properties of the masking \\nwax. \\nThe use of wax-repellant and wax-attractive regions on metal printing plates appeared practical at first. In practice, the original pattern was transferred from \\nan existing photomask to plastic film, shich is required in order to expose \\na photoresist coated metal plate, and the developed plate was then plated with a wax-attractive coating of copper. \\nAiter plating, the photoresist was stripped and the plate was ready for use. The expense of these items was substantial. Production of a \\nfilm image of the pattern cost \\n$6, stainless steel cost $2 and photoresist treatment of stainless steel plates cost an additional \\n$8. Expenses of approximately $10 were required to copper electroplate the steel plate and strip photoresist. The total cost per plate was thus \\n$26. \\nThis cost however, was not a one-time expense. Deterioration of the printing plate, as \\na resu It of scratching and/or wearing of the soft copper plated region required its periodic \\nreplating after 1OO to 200 cycles. Even though the stainless steel plate itself could be reused, the plating process required reapplication \\n?f photoresist and patterning, costing $18 each time, or \\n9 - 18C per substrate. In view of the cost the lithographic method \\nwas dismissed as being impractical. \\n3.1.3 1 NTAGL I0 \\nAlso originally planned for study was intaglio printing, in which wax is \\nborne by depressions in 3 plate, the raised plats areas being resistan+ to \\nwax wetting. Surface tension of the wax causes \"beading\" of TP,e wax in the \\ndepressions,- resulting in wax protruding above the raised p tate areas (Figure 1 1. \\nTrials of thls t*kchnique showed that the masking uax had insufficient surface \\ntension tc cause the required beading. In addition, 8 durable wax arrtiwt*lng \\nagent for the raid plats portions was not found. Stray droplets of wax 6n \\nraised plate portions also contributed to the proble~~~~ associated with this \\nmethod. In view of the impract\\'calities involved, the intaglio technique was \\ndropped from further c0nsiderati.m. \\n3.1.4 LMSS \\nLetterpress printing makes use of a plate that has protrusior.~ in those areas that \\nare to receive wax. Max is applied, usually by roller, and is deposited \\nmainly on the protrusions. The plate is then pressed against the \\nsubsirete, where the wax borne by the protrusions transfers to the substrate (Figure \\n2). \\nPre 1 imi nary tr i a l s of letterpress wax pr i nt i ng conf i rmed its superior i \\nto the other types of image prcduction techniques and it was chosen for use in the remainder of the project. \\n3.2 P!?INTING METHOD \\nThe low-cost production.of printing plates was essential to the success \\nof the project, and methods were developed to produce large quantities of p \\nl ates i nexpeds i ve l y . \\nA master m:d was prepared, by photoresist and wet acid etching processes, of the intended image. \\nThe mold tmk the forff of a negative image cf the printing \\n$late, with depressions in the areas where protrusions were desired on \\nihe plate. In this way printing plates could be produced of any curable liquid material \\nby casting the liquid in the master mold and removing the \\nmaterial in the form of a finished plate after hardening (Figure 3). \\nINTAGLIO PRINTING TECHNIwE \\nPLATE WITH \\nWAX-FiLtEO \\nBEWESS I @NS WAY TRANSFER PATTERNED \\nON CONTACT MASKED SUBSTRATE \\nW l TW SUBSTRATE \\n- - PRIMING PLATE WITH W TRANSFER \\nAWERENT WAX ON CONTACT SUBSTRATE . . \\nWITH SUBSTRATE \\nMASTER WD - MASTER WITH \\n- CURABLE PRINT I NG \\nPUTE MATERIAL - \\nPRINTIS PUTE \\nSEPARATED FROM \\nMASTER \\nIn order to f lnd the master f~ld material capable of mmbining the \\ndesirable qualities of physical durability and the capability of accepting detailed \\net&iq, molds were produced of several materials: a iumi nun, copper, glass, Kovar, - \\nat d sta I n less steel. Exper inlentat ion showed that g lass was unacceptable as a \\nmold material - aside f&n its fragility, it failed ?o etch deeply and displayed \\nan uneven etch rate which made the attainment oi fine-line image feabres - \\nimpossikle. Alu~inurn alsc less than ideal because of its wftness. \\nAluminum also shared a cbm##r.defect with copper - both metals were attacked \\nby acids present in sfme of the materials fmn which plates were mlded, \\nparticularly the RTV silicone rubbers. Stainless steel and Kovar mtds proved the most \\ndetailed and durable. \\nA. - - , \\nMaterials used for printing pfate production were varied. The project \\noriginally sought to employ molten wax as a masking agent, requiring the use . \\nof plate mterial s which were capable of wf thst8nd.i ng sustained elevated temperatures \\ncf approximately -I%%. It was later detemined, for reasons discussed \\nJn Section 3.4, that roan temperature printing with solvent-wax solutions \\nwould be attempted in place of the riot wax printing. This widened the choice of printing \\nplate materials. Those materials tested included: Sylgard \\n!84 (a hro part curable silicanu), castable acrylic, plaster, portland \\nepoxy, vinyl, and polyethylene. Most of these raterials failed for four basic \\nreasons. 1) Brittleness caused crumbling of parts sf the protrusions on the plaster and \\ncement plates. 2) Excessive hardness prevented pla\\'les cclmposed of acrylic \\nand epoxy from contacting the wafet. 31 Absorption of solvent frm, solvent-wax \\nso i ot i ons caused unacceptab I e sue I l i ng of acry l i c , epoxy, and v i ny l p l ates; \\n4; Excessive wear during use caused the rejection of polyethylene as a suitable \\nmaterial. This left Sylgard 184 as tha preferred material; SylgarO is a two- \\npart silicone rubber ccwrposition which is 3 pourable, self-levell ins liquid when freshly \\n?repared. The law viscosity >f tne liquid allows it to fill small \\nfeatures i n ttte master m~l d and to re I l eve i tse l f of any entrapped air bubb I as. - \\nAfter standing for several hours, Sylgard gels complete1 y, fwming a hu*, \\nflexible, slightly elastic substance that pul Is away fmn the mold cleanly. \\nIts elastic property permits the Sylgard plate to comply with the surface of the \\nwafer being printad, even if the wafer has an irregular surface. Mr#eover the \\nSylgafd readily accepts wax or wax solvent mixtures, yet permits easy cleaning \\nin wax solvents. Several printing plates composed of this tnateriar were used. \\nA master mo I d and a Sy I gard pr i nt i ng plate are she-wn in F i gums 4 and 5, \\nrespective I y . \\n3.3 WAX SELECTION \\nEarly in the project, a single wax was chosen as a masking agent. Due to the wide \\nrange of chemical etch reagents - both acid and basic - and highly reactive mixtures that the mask would have to withstand, as well as the local heating \\neffect that sometimes accompanies etching, a high-rnelting micro- \\ncrystalline wax was chosen as the first canaidste material. The wax chosen was \\nMultiwax 19W, a hard material melting at 90O~ and possessing exceptional chemicai inertness. The Multiwax, despite its excellent chemical properties, displayed a iow viscosity when \\nmolten which allowed the printed wax to spread appreciably after being deposited on the wafer surface, thus blurring \\nthe printed pattern and obliterating fine details \\nof the image. The desire for masking agents with higher viscosities and slightly \\ndifferent \\nphysical characteristics led to the investigation of two additional material systems: \\nApeizon W, a black, vacuum distilied asphalt with a working temperature of about \\n115\\'~; and glycol phthelate, a clear ye1 low, glassy substance with \\na strongly temperature-dependent viscosity change nest its melting point of about \\n11~~~. \\n\\n\\nApiezon W was found to be of a high enough viscosity to reduce spreading on polished or etched wafer surfaces and to significantly reduce \\nit on pyramidla \\nl 1 y textured surfaces. Si nce Apt ezon W is a petrol gum-der i ved \\nsubstance similar to tar or asphalt, it has good chemical resistance and \\nenough plasticity when cool to allw it to sag into depressions or channels between pyramids on the wafer surface and to stretch to \\naccomodate any wafer expansion or \\ncontraction due to temperature changes durir;g processins. \\nIn this property also lies the disadvantage of being soft enough to be susceptible to scratching, resulting In possible localized \\nremval of the protective wax layer. \\nGlycol phthalate, the third wax considered for use, is a hard, clear, glassy substance. \\nIt combines hardness (to resist scratches) with a profound viscosity change occurring above its melting point. \\nThe viscosity of \\nthis substance can thus be altered by control of temperature. The viscosity range available \\nis sufficient to prevent wax spreed on any surface. As a disadvantage, the chemical resistance of this wax is only fair. Table \\nI contains the results of a one hour exposure test of the waxes to concentrated processing reagents at \\nroom temperature. While this test imposed conditions \\nmore severe than those anticipated in actual processing, it did identify the reagents that were likely to cause erosion of the wax surface, perhaps causing \\nfailure of the mask layer. As can be seen, glycol phthalate, despite its hard surface, appears \\nto be damaged by nore reagents than the other two \\nwaxes, and is generally affected by reagents to a greater extent than the other waxes. This \\nnateriai is best used where physical hardness is important and where acid content of the etching solution \\nIs low or strongly buffered, as \\nin texture etching. As anticipated, Multiwax 195M is the least affected wax, with Apiezon \\ngiving similar results; these two waxes were cnosen for use iri the \\nremainder of the project. \\nTARE 1: tCISKI MG :-UX ClEMlCAL RESISTANCE \\nETCH REAGENT WE IMT LOSS OF WAX S\\'WLE IN \\nPERCENT AFTER ONE.

In the trials, a wafer was held horizontal ly on a vacuum chuck with the side to be printed facing up. Two centimeters \\nabove the wafer was the Sylgard printing plate, held in \\na horizontal position, parallel to the wafer surface, \\nwith the wax bearing side of the plate facing down. A lever on the printin? \\ndevice was used to drive the printing plate down to contact the wafer, and to elevate the plate \\nonce again after cgntact. The printing plate was waxed by means \\nof a roller dipping into a pool of molten wax. Provisions were made to heat both the printing plate \\nand the wafer-to permit the wax to remain \\nfluid during the print sequence. The print pattern was one which covered the wafer with wax except for \\n3 series of fine concentric circles interconnected \\nby six wide radial spokes. \\nAs originally conceived, the application of patterned etch-resistant coatings to wafer surfaces was to be accomplished \\nby ilsing a printing plate of refractory material to transfer pure molten wax \\nto a heated wafer. Further work pointed out \\nthe difficulty of performing this process and suggested a more practical method \\nof operat ion. \\nThe major difficulty with the original process using molten wax was the necessity of maintaining the wax, \\nth, printing plate, and the wafer surface (along with \\nthe application rollers and auxilliary equipment) at a I-mperature above the wax \\nme1 ting point. Although the temperatures needed are modest (about 120\\'~ - 140~~1, \\na fairly long time was required to heat a quantity of wax to this temperature and \\nto attain an even temperature within the wax mass. In addition, temperature \\nlimiting Is necessary-to avoid smoking or charring of the wax. Aside from \\nproblems of wax stability, the moving parts of the printing mechanism proved \\nto be difffclrit to maintain at controlled temperature; inadvertant coaling of the wax caused parts of \\nthe printirg device to freeze together fiply, and \\nthe still relativety hot device parts had to be allowed to cool before manual separation of the parts could be performed. \\nControl of wax viscosity by \\ntemperature was further limited because the waxes experienced temperature variations during the printing process, making close viscosity control at the moment of printing very difficult. An alternate to molten wax is the use of wax-solvent solutions at \\nroom temperature. The use of such solutions eliminates the necessity of \\nmaintaining an entire printing press at elevated temperature, Additional advantages include the greater control of wax viscosity (by chemical \\nformulation) \\nand greater freedom of selection of printing plate material. Tests were again conducted, this time using a solution of Apiexon \\nW in \\nmethylene chloride, and a suspension of Multiwax 195M in mthylene chloride. Use \\nof a suspension in the case of Multiwax was necessary because Multiwax. \\nhas few true solvents, and those that do dissolve this material either dissolve too \\nlittle to permit the application of an etch resistant coating (as is the case with mineral spirits), or are not volatile enough to permit the solution to dry to \\na \\nhard wax coating (as with mineral oil). The printing device was operated at \\nroom temperat2re, the wax was appiied to the plate by roller (and printed on wafers as previously described), and the \\nprintad wafars were either allowed to air dry or were subjected to \\na 50°c bake cycle for 30 minutes before acid etching. \\n3.5 IMAGE FIDELITY \\nThe major problem associated with the process was that of attaining consistent \\nreproauctlon of the wax mask Image. Although the use of special \\ntest pl-\\'es confirmed the ability qf tha process to produce 2 - 5 mil lines, \\nthese results were produced too rarely to warrant claims of a perfected pr-ocass. \\nSpecifically, problems resulted from spreading of wax from its point of \\na~plication, failure to make firm contact between the printing plate and moderately warped wafers, and the rare but nevertheless frustrating occurances of wafers sticking to \\nthe printing plate by means of a \"suction-cup\" effect. Also, use of the Multiwax suspension was discootinued, since \\nit was noted that the discreet particles of wax in the \\nsuspensian produced a grainier image than the Apiezon \\nW solutions. In an effort to improve \\nimage fidelity, a cylindrical printing plate configuration was tested. In this variation of the technique, \\na printing plate was fashioned in the shape of a cylinder which was waxed and then rolled over the wafer surface. Since such \\nEn arrangement requires the plate to contact the wafer along a line, rather than over an area, plate-to-wafer contact was improved and suction-cup effects were eliminated. Spreading of wax still resulted. An \\nanalys~s of the spreading problem has led to the conclusion that it \\nmay be inherent in the process applied to hard substrates. A wax coating, applied to the printing plate in a thickness adequate to ensure transfer of a protective amount of wax to the silicon wafer surface, was squeezed out from between the \\n?late and wafer when contact was made. The analogous process of \\nletterset printing on paper appears highly dependent on substrate (paper) properties. Paper possesses the attributes of flexibility and absorptivity, neither one \\nof \\nwhich is displayed by the hard and impenetratable silicon of which solar cells are maae. The \\no~arrowness of the lines which are etched through the passivating oxide \\nor nitride To accommodate the current-coilectincj metai pattern is \\nnecessary to prevent excessive shading of the cell. This narrowness, it \\nwas found, virtually assures that the wax applied to adjacant areas wi 1 I be squeezed out into the thin \\nline region, preventing it ft.m etching in the desired way. Figures \\n6 and 3 depict .;etails of the line pattern. Figure 6 \\nis a view of the pattern on the original photomask showing the desired line d \\nimnsions. Figure 7 shows the corre5pondiny pattern when wax is Fri nted or, the wafer. Since wax squeezing \\nis not perfectly regular, this effect cannot be \\ncompensated for by using wider lines on the plate. \\n3.6 WAX REMOVAL In an attempt to reduce or \\nelimiqate the use of organic solvents (and the problems associated with their toxicity and disposal) the project originally intended to develop a \\nsolventless removal method for cleaning wsfers after the chemical etching step. Also intended was the capability \\ncf recovering and recycling the wax. Early experiments showed that up to \\n70% of masking wax could be removed \\nfrom wafers by simply immersing them in boiling water, or in water to which a heavy salt, \\ne.g. potassium sulfate, had been added. In this removal method, wax simply \\nmelts and floats to :he surface of the water where it can ba \\n.immed off. The addition of a heavy ~?it raises both the boiling point and the density of the water, accelerating the process. The early experiments were, of necessity, \\ncor~ducted with wafers coated with rhick, continuous layers of wax, most of \\nrihici~ was easi ly removed. Later work, using patterned wafers with thinner coatings \\nof wax demonstrated that \\nthe relatively small amount of wax on the wafers melted, but clung to the wafer \\nzurface. \\n\\n\\nAttempts at uslrrg blasts of bo~ hot water and steam succeeded in \\nremoving more wax, but the rcmved wax was dispersed as fine dro~leis In the \\nwater and did not separate fran the water, so that recovery Mas impracticdl, \\nIn all cases, enough wax mined on the wafers tcr make a solvent clem necessary anyway, \\nThe preferred cleaning .lathed was aetemtined to be 3 solvent clean using \\nparchloroethylane in a degreaser apparatus ithe~e the wafers are cleafised by \\nhaving refluxing perchloroethylene dissolve the wax. Recovery of the wax is \\nstill possible with this method by removing perchlor@ethylene through simple disti \\nl lation. \\n4.0 GM LUS l ONS \\nThe mncluslons drawn from the resuits of this project are listed beiow: \\n1. Melted wax, e.g. .Nuitiwax 19W, was very resistant tc chemical attack by \\nall reagents tested, but required a heated apparatus for \\ndeposition; this proved to be ta~ variable for practical use. \\n2. #ax solutions iit the form of A~iezon k\\' or one of its available \\ncmrcial preparations, could be printed onto siliccn substrates, and were found to be useful in \\nmasking wafers Aring wet etching \\nprik-ssses. \\n5. - Gf the four printins processes investigated (transfer, Iithqraphy, \\nintagtic! and letterpress), only ietterpress demonstrated the possible \\npromi se of pract i ca l use. \\n4. The application of petterned wax resist coatings by means of jetterpress \\nprinting suffers frm wax solutien squeezing between the plate and the \\nsilicon substrate, Cylindrical plates also show this property. Control \\nof this flow will be necessary for practical implementation cf the \\nprocass. \\n5. KO cracticai alternative to the use of oraanic solvants for removal \\nof was was found.

Add it iona l \\neffort might solve the remaining problems. However, with the advent of an \\nentirely new technology for patterning dielectric layers on silicon, it is \\nquestionable whether further effort on wax masking would be eesirable. \\nDemonstrations of fine-line plasma etching of dielectric layers through a \\nreuseable metal mask have already been made. The full development of this process \\nwill undoubtedly result in more eccnomic wafer processing, less \\nconsumed material, and iess disposed waste, than is possible with any wax process that \\nrtxists today. \\n6.0 NEW TECHNOLOGY \\nThis project had 3s its goal the application of existing processes to \\nthe manufacture of solar cells.

SUMMARY \\n0 \\nThe process developed under this contract meets the f \\nPhase-I objective of the Silicon Materials Task of the i \\nLow-Cost Solar Array Project: to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a process capable of high-volume production \\n/r of solar-ceil-grade silicon. Work was perfo&ed during the period from July 31, 1976 through October 31, 1978. \\nI The Dow Corning Process consists of producing silicon via the carbothermic reduction of quartz utilizing high- purity raw materials. This silicon is subsequently purified \\ni to solar-grade silicon by pulling a polycrystalline ingot via \\nthF1\" Czochralski process. , O \\nCommercial sources of raw materials were. identified that meet the requirements of price, chemical reactivity, \\n, and \\nT possibly purity. These sources resulted from a broad survey of silica and \\ncarbon materials. The purest silicon attainable \\nI. . 11 was produced from quartz, mined from both United States\\' ,, \\nand Canadian deposits, and carbon black/sucrose pellets. 1 \\nA reliable analytical technique must yet be developed to I;, \\nprovide quality assuran\\'ce of the raw materials. Stable and \\nc~ntinuoGs silicon production was demonstrated \\n- - -- . in a 200-kVA Dirct Arc Reactor to produce quantities of silicon in excess of \\n100 kg per experiment. A production rate as high as \\n3 kg/h was accomplished at an energy con- \\nsaption as low as 26 kWh/kg Si. The silicon analyzed to be relatively pure, having concentrations of 50-100 ppmw for aluminum and iron and of less than \\n10 ppmw each for other impurities. Based on \\nconrmercial experience no major \\nj scale-up problems are ,envisio?ed for this process step. \\n\\\\ \\nI $I However, more sophisticated handling of raw materials \\n+ , \\ni should be developed. Purification of Direct-Arc-Reactor silicon to solar- \\n\" \\nI \\ngrade quality was explored using crystal growth and vacuum !\\' \\nevaporation. No reduction in the concentration of any I \\\\ \\n11 \\n\\' N 5 1 \\ni\\' - \\n.:I \\nSegregation of impurities during i ingot production using FJ \\nBridgman-type crystal growth was demonstrated to be \\\\> \\n.\\' I feasible. However, it was not pursued , t in depth due to the \\n> greater degree of technical sophistication of Czochralski - \\ncrystal-growth technology. (A E \\nPurification of Direct-Arc-Reactor silicon to solar- \\ngrade quality was demonstrated to be possible using Czochralski crystal growth to produce a polycrystalline ingot. during the \\nInsf, experiment performed under this ccankract. \\nImpurity segregation was\\' as effective as single-crystal growth from semiconductor silicon \\n\\'kince the melt was dilute enough to prevent constitutional supercooling. Analysis of the polycrystalline silicon \\ningot , showed the final product to \\nbe of semiconducts\\'or purity except for A1 (1 ppma.), Bo \\n(7 ppma, 0.1 ohm-cm) , and P (0.5 ppma) . \\nSingle-e-rys tal silicon was \\\\produced from the poly- \\ningot using a second Czochralski crystal-growth operation. This single-crystalline material was fabricated into solar cells that demonstrated conversion \\nefficiencies ranging J - \\nfrom 8.2% to .greater than 14% (AM1 , AR-Coeted) depending upon the fabricator and the cell fabrication technique. \\ni \\nMore detailed solar cell evaluations should be performed. A cost analysis of the Dow Corning Process at \\na \\n3000-MT/y rate, in 1975 dollars with no profit, showed that the estimated cost of silicon from the Direct Arc Reactor \\n\\' \\nto be $2.28/kg. Final solar-grade silicon cost is dependent cj \\n1 * \\nupon the cost assumptions made from Czochralski growth. A i \\nfinal cost of $7.54/kg is possible if 3Q-cm-diameter ingots I\\\\ \\ncan be pulled continuously with 90-% yield. Today\\'s crystal growth technology would allow \\na final cost of $11.70/kg \\nwhen pulling a 15-cm-diameter ingot at an 80-7. yield. \\nA_,\\'complete energy analysis of the Dow Corning Process * \\n\\\\- from raw materials through solar-grade silicon product \\nind5cates that only a 5-month period is required to pay back 4\\' \\nthe energy consumed in the overall process. A 12-% AM1 cell was assumed to be exposed for 5 hours each day to \\na solar \\n2 flux of 100 mW/crn, .

Introduction \\nI This report covers technical effort performed under JPL contract during the period from July 31, 1976 through October 31, 1978. \\nThe contract work was carried out under Phase I \\nof Part I11 of the Silicon Material   ask of JPL\\'s Low-Cost Solar Array \\n(LSA) Project. The LSA Project objective is to \"develop national capability \\nto produce low-cost, long-life photovoltaic arrays \\nat a rate greater than 500 MW/y and at a price less * than $500/k~ by 1986 with array performance goals of >lo-% P efficiency and >20-y operating lifetime\". (1) . The long- term objective of the Silicon Materials Task is to \"establish installed plant capability for producing silicon suitable \\n* for solar cells at a price less than $lO/kg at a rate equivalent to \\n$500/kW \" (!,)\\\\. P The past 27-month effort hds been directed at meeting the short-term objective of the \\nPhase-I/Part-I11 portion of the Silicon Materials \\nTask: \"to establish the technical feasibility and practicality of \\na process capable of high- \\nvolume production of solar-cell-grade siliconU(l). \\nDow Corning\\'s approach to meeting the above objective has been to develop and interface two major \\npyocess steps: a chemical process step of reducing silica to silicon, with carbon as the reductant, followed by a physical process step of purification by means of impurity segregation during solidification of the molten silicon. This basic concept is shown schematically in Figure 1. \\nA major advantage in the Dow Corning approach is that the basic technology exists today for carrying out each process step. Silicon of \\n98-% purity is commercially produced in 20,000-metric-ton-per-year electric akc furnaces. \\n* In 1975 dollars \\nix \\n(2 - d \\n0 \\n4 \\n\\n- This cornpares to tha estimnCad SoG-Si rmquiran\\\\a~t in 1986 of \\nonly 3000-6000 MT/~*. 2ke problam to be solved in this process \\nstep is to produce silicon of .greater thbn 98-8 \\npurity by rsaoting high-puriCy raw makarials in b noneon- i taminciting sadiatmr.

The ideal technique should be accurate, precise, fast, low \\ncost, anh highly sensitive for impurities /- of ,interest.

Summary Determination of the yields of impurities in each process step \\nallowed.the-max~mum permissible concentration of impurities in the raw materials to be calculated from \\na definition of SoG-Si (see Table 1). Boron and phosphorus fi \\nwere shown to be the most critical impurities. \\n\\\\- i\\' A survey of over 90 sources of silica indicated that \\n1; quartz can possibly meet purity goals. This must be tested by determining boron and phosphorus in the silicon product due to the lack of reliable analytical techniques for measuring their concentrations in quartz. Two commercial \\nsources of quartz were identified as meeting the require- \\nZ \\nments of cost and chgmical reactivity. Quartz sands still remain to be examined as potential \\n+ \\nsources of silica. Cursory investigation shows that sands \\' \\nare available that meet purity anld cost goals. -These sands must be further pelletized and tested for reactivity. Several carbon sources were examined as potential reductants: activated carbon, carbon black, wood and sugar \\n\\' \\ncharcoal, lignite, and petroleum coke. Only activated carbon and carbon black pellets meet the goals of high purity and high chemical reactivity. The latter goal \\ni,s \\nespecially reached when activated carbon and carbon black \" \\nare used in conjunction with sucrose either \\'in the form D \\ni>-.> i-/of sugar cubes or as a binder for pellets. \\n13. Purity Requirements --- \\'0 \\nIt is ncces.sary to establish the maximum allowable \\n(- \\nimpuri.ties in raw materials used for the Dow Corning P~occss - \\nsince a r;pecific degree of p~lrifi.cation occurs for each \\\\> \\nelement in the two process steps. The second process step \\nof unidirection solidification is especial-ly effective for \\n10 ,jn~GmAL $AGE T\\'K \\nP~R QBTP~L!~ \\nremoving impurities because their distribution is orders- \\n-, of-magnitude less in the solid phase as compared to the \\nmo\\'lten phase--except for boron (17-0.8) and phosphorus \\n(rp0.35). Since relatively little purification occurs during \\nthe~first process step of silicon production, raw materials must contain low concentrations of \\nboron and phosphorus. \\n0 \\nA method of determining the maximum concentration of impurities allowable in the raw \\nmatkials is to start with the maximum allowable concentration in the solar \\n- \\ngrade silicon (SoG-Si) product and to calculate backwards 1.l \\nto the saw materials using the yields ~f the impurities in both process steps. In doing this, various assumptions must be made that have an end effect on the \\nfinal calculated concentrations. Therefore, the assumptions are discussed so that any later changes in \\nthem can be taken into consider- ation in terms of their effect on the calculated impurity requirements for the \\nraw materials. Two sources of ihformation wer help develop \\na the maximum permissible impurity levels in SoG-Si. For boron, various data predict solar cell efficiency to peak between 0.1 ohm-cm (2-5) and about \\n0.3 ohm-cm (15,16) which corresponds \\n5 \\nto boron concentrlations between 9.6 and 1.7 ppma, respectively. The maximum concentration \\nof 1.7 ppma for boron was chosen so as to \\nbe conservative. An aluminum conceatration of \\\\ 0.2 ppma was chosen so as to be one order-of-maqnitude lower than the other p-type dopant boron. \\n~hos~horus \\nwas set at 0.5 ppma so as not to heavily compensate boron. The metal- concentrations were obtained \\nErom Westinghouse- \\nDow Corning data (6) of relatfve cell efficiency versus impurity concentratian; an efficiency \\n90 % of baseline was chosen, \\nThe various assumed impurity concentrations are summarized in Table 1. \\nw Table I lists the calculated maximum concentrations of \\nimpurities that can be in silicon Erom the Direct Arc Reactor (DAR) assuming \\ndjkit DAR-Si of the given composition is converted to \\nSoG-Si via the Czochralski technique of unidirectional \\nk* 4 \\n11 \\n\\n3 solidification. Impurity segregation coefficients between molten and solid silicon were taken from a recent Westing- \\n* house report (6). Segregation coefficients are in effect the fractional impurity yields during the second process \\n#t step. As an example of the calculation method, the maximum aluminum concentration of \\n0.2 ppma was divided by the aluminum segregation coefficient of \\n2 x lo3 to obtain the \\n100 ppma maximum concentration,,iq ! -> DAR-Si. An even higher \\nconcentration is most likely allowable since all aluminum in -* \\nsilicon is not electrically active from the standpoint of , \\n, resistivity measurements. \\n\\\\\\' Z \\nThe calculated maximum t2oncentrations of Cu, Fe, Ni, and \\nZr are so high that they would cause supercooling of the \\njl melt and eventual breakdown of impurity segregation during Czochralski ingot growth resulting in low SoG-Si yield. It \\nI is assumed that a 90-% ingo& yield wi.11 result if total , \\nI metal concentration in the melt is kept less than 400 ppma. \\ni , This assumption is based upon practical experience in pulling \\nf \\nI ingots from silicon having impurities varying between 2% \\nI-- \\nI\\' (metallurgical grade) and sub-ppma (semic\\'onductor grade) levels. \\n1 Therefore, 400 ppma is used in Table 2 for the maximum \\nperdissible concentration of Cu, Fe, ~i \\'and Zr in DAR-Si. \\n> \\ni This upper linit is also used for Ca and Mo since both have very favorable segregation coefficients--this \\nassumestca is similar to Mg \\n(6). $ \\nThe revised maximum levels of impurities in DAR-Si were used to calculate their maximum levels in the raw materials \\n\\'by using impurity yields that occur during the first process step. These yields were measured by Interlake, Inc. over a 5-day period in a 30-MVA commercial arc furnace used to produce \\n98 % silicon at a rate of about 1 MT/h. The yields (recoveries) of the impurities in silicon are shown in \\n~igure 2 \\n1 I \\nj and are seen to be inversely related to their elemental \\n11 \\nI! vapor pressures (7). \\n2 x. 0 \\n,by/ I\\' i G) \\n!I i\\' 1, t \\\\i \\\\, \\nI \\n{ \\n\\'E \\\\\\\\ \\nSt 13 \\nF if 4 \\n.. \\n4 \\n\\nThe maximum level of impurities in carbon land silica, as seen in Table 2,\\' indicate that the impurities can be divided into three categories: (1) boron and phosphorus which must have concentrations in about the \\n1 to 10-ppma range, (2) aluminum, titanium, and vanadium which can be in the \\n10 to 4 \\n100-ppmw range, and (3) ,,the remaining impurities that can \" \\nrange from 0.2 to 2 %. The requirement of having boron and phosphorus present at the low 1 to \\n10-ppmw level almost guarantees that the levels of all other impurities will fall considerably below their maximum allowable concentrations in the raw materials. This \\nbecomes obvious from the analysis of \\nsil-ha and carbon shown in later sections of this report. \\nThe need to use higher-purity raw materials in the silicon production step can be recognized when \\ncomparing the impurity goals for \\nDAR-Si to actual impurity analyzes of \\nI \\nL* metallurgical-grade silicon (MG-Si). The comparison in Table \\n3 indicates that the concentration of Al, B, Fe, and \\nw , P impurities in MG-Si are more than an order-of-magnitude higher than their concentration goals for DAR-Si. \\n\\nTable 19. comparison of Impurity Concentxations \\'in MG-Si \\nto the Ooal for DAR-Si. \\n:> \\nSilica \\n\\'1.

Although this quartzite has not been extensively analyzed \\nu,nder this contract, it \\nis clear that its aluminum concentration is the *, major deterent i-n its use aS a raw material for SOG-Si \\nprodiiidtion. Aluminum contents have been analyzed to be in \\nthe 300-500 ppmw range as compared to the goal of 60 ppmw. \\n\\\\\\\\ The existence of deposits in North America of sand, \\n5 \\n-if quartzite, and quartz, having sufficient purity for the , hydrothermal growth of quartz for piezoelectr,Jc applica- \\ntions, has been reported by Kolb, et al. (8)4\\' \\nCJ Dow Corning and Interlake, Inc. performed a survey of \\nti \\n\\'j, CI over 90 forulgn and domestic sources of silica to ascertain \\n,$ their location and accessibility, representative composition, R \\n\\'I and estimated commercial price. State geologists were \\n1 2s contacted, where possible, to verify reported information. \\nSanples for analysis were received from 36 domestic and \\nforeign sources. Boron and phosphorus were always deter- \\nmined due to the low concentrations required. Aluminum and iron were analyzed \\noccaqionally since they are the only \\nother impurities detebtable in high-quality silica. Exper- ience early in the program indicated that other impurities were not present above \\nthe usual 5 to 10-pprnw detection limit of the analytical technique.

Pellets \\nP All activated carbon and carbon black reductants were used in the form of pellets. Activated carbon from Union \\n() \\nCarbide was suppl\\'ied as ca. 3-mm-size pellets that were 0 \\nused either directly in the DAR~\\';O~ as a mixture with sucrose sugar cubes. The use of sugar cubes was found to increase the chemical reactivity of the dense activated carbon since the sucrose is converted to \\na high-surface- - - \\narea sugar charcoal upon burning at the top of reactant \\n2 mix in the DAR. All carbon black reductants had to be pelletized to - \\nincrease their micron-size particles to 5 to 25-mm-size \\\\\\\\ - \\npellets that would not be blown out of the DAR by the off- gases. Early experiments utilized binders such as starch, colloidal silica, silica flour, and their mixtures. Starches \\nI were not pure enough, especially with respect tij\\'phos- \\nphorus. Later experiments used carbon black bound with sucrose which is higher in purity. As in the case \\nof _:. \\nactivated carbon, sucrose was also found to increase the reactivity of the reactant mixture. Analyses of binders are shown in Table 10. Carbon black \\npellets were normally prepared for Dow Corning \\nby Mars Minerals, Inc. using special handXing . \\ntechniques. Drum pelletizers were used to produce all pellets \\ne,xcept when sucrose was used as a binder. In w \\nthis case, it was necessary to use a disc pelletizer. The analyses of the pellets are provided in Table 11.

Charcoal has been purified with freon at high 1 \\' ! temperatures to reduce the concentration . of impurities \\n(7,9,10) as seen- in Table 1T. ~atisf actory reduction of the level of boron \\nand phosphorus was found only at 2500 \\'C. \\nHowever, this material was found to be nearly totally unreactive with quartz under \\nnoqtal operating conditions, \\nas opposed to unpurified charcoal which is a fairly good &-=\\' reductant. The purified \\ncharcoll was characterized by x-ray diffraction and chemical reactivity tests \\n(7). X-ray diffraction patterns showed a broad and somewhat irregular peak in the vicinity \\nof the graphite peak. The irregular peak increased in intensity with the temperature of charcoal purification and was not observed in the case \\nof unpurified . \\ncharcoal. Since change in chemical composition due to \\npui~ification is minimal, significant structural change was indicated. This was particularly apparent from the noted volume decrease with purification temperature. Reactivity \\n. \\ntests, according to a method reported by Tuset and Raaness \\n(ll), showed that purified charcoql had a somewhat lower ability to react with \\nSiO(g) that did unpurified charcoal according to the reaction \\nSiO (g) + 2C (s) = Sic (s) + CO (g) . \\nHowever, it was still found to be more reactive than most reductants used for silicon production. It was therefore inferred that the formation of silicon carbide was not the rate-controlling reaction, but that-its \\nfuvther reaction \\nvia SiC(s) + SiO (g) = 2 Si (1) + CO [g) was most likely the \\nJ \\nrate-controlling step. The reason for this may be tha>t \\nSic is completely surrounded by silicon which blocks the \\n1 * \\ncbntact between Sic and SiO. If so, the.wetting property \\nL : ,,,: of S3C is important.

Summary Reactors \\nof 50-kVA and 200-kVA size were used to study the production of silicon using three different reductants \\nC for quartz: charcoal, activated carbon, and carbon black. Charcoal was eliminated as a possible reductant because it becomes very \\nunreacbive when purified at high temperature. :S \\nCarbon black/sucrose mixtures are superior to actb~ated \\ncarbon with respect to reactivity, energy consumption, and \\npuriky . q \\nThe best experiment utilizing carbon blask/sucrose \\npellets gave 128 kg Si during a 50-h experiment corres- ponding to an effective silicon production rate of 2.9 \\nkg/h. \\nEnergy usage was favorable in a small esperimental reactor \\nat only 26 kWh/kg Si. Typical silicon produced from such \\n\\'3 experiments contained 50-100 ppmw of alun~inum and iron and less than 10 ppmw each of other impurities. \\nB. Experimental \\n1. General . - \\n! Silicon was produced in two, somewhat similar direct arc reactors during the course of the contract. Early experiments Were performed from September, 1976 to \\nAugust,1977 \\nin a 50-kVA reactor (DAR-50) located at Elkem-Spigerverket\\'s \\nR&D Center in KriskSansand, Norway. Later experiments were performed during the period from February to October, 1978 in a \\n200-kVA reactor (DAR-200) purchased by Dow Corning from \\nElkem-Spigerverket. \\nDAR-50 is shown in cross-sectional view in Figure 3. \\nDimensions are in millimeters. The DAR is divided into a \\nseparate upper and bottom section. The upper section is divided into two sections along its axis. \\nA:$0% A1203/ 50% \\nu Si02 ceramic lining is contained within a cast iron shell. \\n37 \\n\\n, \\nThe bottom section of the DAR is ceramic lined and contains electrode \\npas-te which provides circuit completion for the \\na arc struck between the electrode and the graphite hearth. The external power supply is connected to the graphite \\nF electrode at the top Ad to the copper electrodes inbedded I: \\n)I in the carbonized paste at the bottom. A spout is provided for tapping silicon metal from the graphite hearth. The spout consists of graphite coated with chemically5-vapor- deposited silicon carbide. \\n<\\\\- >/ \\nI\\' DAR-200 is a much-improved version of DAR-50. The main differences, however, are in the larger size smelting pot (60-cm I.D.) and electrode (15-cm \\nI.D.). Changes in the electrical system provided for much more control of the carbothermic \\n\"reduction process. The ceramic liner used in \\nthe.zDAR has potential ofo \\ncontributing significant impurities to the smelting process. This potential was \\nminimized through pse-contract experiments \\nC that pointed out values for reactor parameters which provide insulation of the ceramic liner by unreacted raw materials \\n4. - from the high-temperature smelting zone. This is easily done by maintaining the electrode diameter small enough so \\ndv, \\nas to not form too large of a cavity within the reactor (see Fig. \\n4). Such an insulation effect can also be attained by employing a sufficiently large reactor diameter once an optimum electrode diameter has been determined. Figure \\n4 \\nshows the cross section of the DAR,after half of the upper hearth section was removed following a successful experiment. The cavity that surrounds the electrode had its walls formed by strong \\nsintered material consisting of partially reacted raw materials and silicon carbide. Unreacted raw materials are shown external to the cavity walls. Experiments were run somewhat similarly. Quartz was crushed and screened to \\n-30 + 5 mm size while the carbon \\nsize\\'.varied considerably. These materials were charged to \\nY // the DAR every 1-2 h in a mixture having greater than 1&00% \\n3 \\n39 \\n(1 \\n\\ncarbon content*. Such an amount of carbon causes the formation of silicon carbide, which is \\nrequired for later \\nsilicon production, at the bottom of the furnace. After 8- \\n24 hours, the carbon content was reduced to provide suitable \\nI reaction conditions for producing silicon. At the end of \\na 1 to 2-h period, silicon was removed -?I \\nfrom the DAR. The walls of the cavity around the electrode were then crushed with graphite rods. A new charge of raw materials was added to the furnace and smelting was con- tinued for another 1 to 2-h period. DAR-50 was run at 40 \\nkW with the voltage between the hearth and the electrode varying from 30-40 \\nV. Reaction conditions were controlled by varying the distance between the tip of the \\nelef.?trode and the hearth. DAR-200 was 4 operated at abouty\\'80 kW with the potential varying from about 50-60 \\nV. i \\n* (7 \\n2.

I - \\nV \\nd 3 \\n1 The important message $0 be gained from the data in Table 14 is that it is difficult to produce large quantities of silicon using purified charcoal as a reductant. Consequently, \\nlow,production rates occur with accompanying \\\\ high energy usage. These trends are more obvious when it is realized that extraordinary operating conditions had to be used to make the silicon that was obtained.> It is believed that such conditions, \\ne.g., a low carbon content in the 800% \\nrange, cannot be used to commercially produce silicon. The problem of poor charcoal reactivity is treated in depth in the earlier \"Raw \\nMaterialss\\' section of this report. Emission spectrographic analyses of the silicon produced from charcoal-reductant experiments are provided in Tables \\n&, \\' \"ii \\n15 and 16. Samples were obtained by melting:,-down 1 kg of DAR-Si in a Czochralski puller to homogenize the sample. \\nA sample of silicon was withdrawn by suction casting it in \\na small diameter quartz tube to quickly solidify it, thereby \\nC minimizing segregation of impurities. This sample, after removal from the tube, was submitted for analysis. The \\n5 ?a use of purer raw materials obviously resulted in production of purer silicon. The data also confirms, in specific instances, that the gain in purity through use of better raw materials can be offset by use of inconsistent purification of charcoal, contamination of the raw materials by further \\nir) handling after purification, and by6ontamination of the \\n,- 2 \\nreactants in the xeactor by airborne,,materials or by acciden- tally dropping \\ncon tam in an;^ into the reactor. \\n4 \\nBoron and phosphorus analyses were performed on DAR-Si \\nthat had gone through the purification step.

In one growth experiment a single-crystal seed was used and pulling continued until loss of crystalline structure, due to constitutional supercooling, was observed. \\nA poly- \\ncristalline seed. was used in the second experiment and poly- 1 \\ncrystalline ingot growth qllowed to proceed until feathering \\' \\nof the outer ingot surfice was observed indicating the onset .# \\nof constitutional supercooling; (see the bottom of the large ingot indicated in Figure \\n5) Grain size was such as to \\n2 produce a grain density of 20/cm . \\nSamples were selected from the full-diameter region of the ingots just below the seed, from the region just above the point where \\nconstitbtional supercooling occurred, and from the tang end of the ingots (approximately \\n4 cm after constitutional supercooling occurred).

The relatively high concentration prior to the occurrence of \\n1 constitutional supercooling has been observed in other \\ni \\nd ingots and is attributed to impurity trapping during cell- \\nular growth. Once constitutional supercooling occurs, the \\nr \\neffective segregation coefficients increase from near their equilibrium values in the seed end of the ingots to very large values approaching \\n0.2 for copper and 0.5 for manganese. \\n3 These data imply that polycrystalline ingot growth is just as effective as single crystalline ingot growth for segregating impurities from the solid into the melt. The data also suggest \\n\\' \\n,.. \\nI I> that segregation is less efficient for melts more concentrated \\n1 in impurities. However, the impurities in DAR-Si are low \\n?( enough in concentration, as shown in Section VP.B.2.b, such J \\nti * \\n1 that segregation is a very efficient purification technique for this material. \\nW-i \\n{I Higher growth yields of polycrystalline ingots are \\n.(! \\nf expected compared to the yields experienced for single- \\ni crystalline ingots in the semiconductor industry.

Other benefits of\\' polycrystalline i growth are reduced seeding problems, e.g. due to twinning, and use of larger diameter poly-seeds for pulling massive ingots. \\n2. 1\\' Poly-Ingot Compositional Analysis (3 \\na. Boron and Phosphorus The cancentrations of boron and phosphorus \\n1 \\nf were determined from electrical resistivity measurements \\n4 + made on single-crystal silicon. The procedure involves first pulling a small-diameter poly-ingot from \\nDAR-Si in \\nm a ~zochralski machine, as indicated in Figure 5. This ingot was then multiply float zoned leaving sections that \\nI, \\nfl \\n4 3 \\ni( ,*. ar \\n55 \\nhad been zoned from one to seven times. Electrical resistivity measurements made on the various sections provided data for computing the boron and phosphorus \\nd concentrations (see Ref. 14 for details). These values * \\nwere then adjusted to represent the actual concentratidns\\' r2 \\nof the impurities in the original SoG-Si ingot. Y \\nBoron and phosphorus analyses- were performed only on \\nSoG-Si ingots pulled from DAR-Si produced in the experi- \\n,merits indicated in Table 21 due to the amount of work required per analysis. The SoG-Si of highest purity was \\n\" J \\nan ingot pulled from, silicon produced during experiment , - \\nI\\' DAR-200-17. The boron concentration was 6.8 ppma (0.12 \\' \\nohm-cm) and the phosphorus concentration was 0.45 ppaa3. , , \\nThe data from this experiment were reproduced in two . \\\\ 3 experiments performed after contract termination. \\n0 \\nHow do the data from experiment DAR-200-17 compare to . \\nthe specifications suggcstad for SoG-Si in Table l? The \\nphosphorus concentration met the suggested masfmum specification, \\nof 0.5 ppma. The boron concentra,pion of 7 ppma (0.1 ohm-cm), + \\nhowever, exceeds the suggested specificetion of 2 ppma \\nC\\' (0.3 ohm-cm) . Since the suggested boron specification is by no \\nneans a rigidly determined value, see Section IV.B, it is interesting to compare \\nit to information reported in the \\nliterature. Our 0.1 ohm-cm esactly matches the value reported \\nby Green (3) and by Dunbar and Hauser (4) £or, Phe doping resistivity \\n\\'giving maximum soaar cell efficiency . Iles and \\nSoclof (15), in addition to Fischer and Pschunder (lb), \\nindicate solar cell efficiency should peak around 0.3 G \\nohm-cm such that our SoG-St would produce cells having an output only \\n94% of maximnum. Therefore, even though the silicon from \\n-experiment DAR-200-17 did not meet the con- , \\nservatiye 0.3 ohm-cm specification, the 0.1 ohm-cm material cones very \\nciose to the maxirncm in cell efficiency versus resistivity data reported by various investigators. \\n  he blcimate test of SoG-SI lies in the quality of \\n! \\nthe solar cells, it can produce (see Sectiop VII). A \\n! \\n8t conpo~itional specification is also required. \\nI \\ni Close &exaqination of Table 21 su~ges ts t&at various \\n1 reductions ,in *the, conantration of boron or phosphorus \\nI \\n56 3 i l;i \\n\\nmight be directly tied to changes in carbon black (CB) \\nor quartz sources of supply. The gradual reductions in impurities were partially due to ever improving methods of clean operation of the DAR, \\nespeAally \\'during later d \\n11 experiments. The most obvious reduction in phosphorus can be definitely traced to the use of Thermax Stainless \\n*I \\ncarbon black in experiment DAR-200-17. Again, this low, concentration of phosphorus in \\nSoG-Si was coniirmed by \\nlater experiments in the DAR. > \\\\ \\nO 0 \\nb. Other Impurities Analysis of the final Dow Corning product for impurities other than boron and phosphorus is difficult since the impurities are about equivalent to the con- centrations found in semiconductor-grade silicon. An analysis \\nof the SoG-Si ingot at the 50-% point of the silicon pulled \\n- from experiment DAR-200-17 is shown in column three of Table \\n22. The analysis was perfomsd in. i C - Dow Corning\\'s spark-source mass spectrometer that has \\noniy analyzed pure semicbnductor-grade silicdn. All e \\nnt,. indicated impurities in the SoG-Si could not be detected, at the 3-30 ppba sensitivity \\naf the instrument, except \\' \\nfor sodium which was present at 3 ppba. Nearly identical results are found when analyzing semiconductor silicon; \\nn 1.. all impurities analyze to have concentrations lower than their detection \\nlirrits of 3-30 ppba. ~arliE$+ work ( \\n(10) showed that there was nu detectable di.kferenc\\'e.$n \\nthe purity of the silicon between the 40-% and 65-% amounts of the total silicon \\nJ pulled. No difference in quality is expected between the \\n0 to 76-% portions (see next section). , \\nEarlier reported data (10) indicated that a reasonable estimate of impurity concentrations in, the \\nSoG-Si ingot L \\ncould be obtained by multiplying the effective segregation coefficients times the impurity \\nconcentrqtions found in the * \\nDAR-Si. The results of tfiis appear in8Table 22 where the , 7 c.- \\nimpurity concentrations (now in ppma) of silicon from L \\nexperiment ~~~~200-17 +A have been multiplied by the effective \\n4 segregation coefficients reported in Reference 6. The \\n1 \\n1 estimated cancentrations are less than the SoG-Si specifi- \\ni . 112 cations from Table 1 in all instances. i 58 \\nr . -* \\n\\nThese low values of impurity concentrations should permit the Dow Corning polycrystalline ingot to meet or exceed any specifications far such impurities in SoG-Si. \\n.. \\n3.

The corresponding - \\ncrucible capacities consi,dered - were 45, 81, and 450 kg of silicon, Cost numbers were calculated based \\non =2 the following assumptions: \\nDAR-Si can be effectively purified by the Bridgman- type process to \\nyield 90-% usable silicon. \\nInstalled capital cost for the process was estimated at 2.5 times the equipment cost and depreciated \\nover a period of seven years. \\nI Furnace cool-down, clean-up and maintenance was \\nF considered to be 20% of the total gr~wtp~cycle. \\nI Power consumption was estimated at 25 XWh/kg Si \\nfor a 45-kg charge and 20 kMh/kg for a 450-kg charge. The power cost was estimated at \\n$0.025/k~h. \\nThe weight of the silicon charge and rate of the ingot growth\\'were the \\ntwo single most important factors which * \\naffected the cost of the purified silicon. The power,con- \\nsumption was also a significant cost item. At a growth rate of 5 \\ncm/h using a silicon charge weighing 45 kg, the puri- fication cost was calculated to be \\n$3.96/kg sLlicon. At a higher growth rate of 11.5 \\ncn/h from a 450-kg crucible charge, silicon \\ncould be purified at a cost asZlow as $1.48/ \\' \\nkg Si, assuming all technical assumptions could be met. 3. Conclusions \\n, \\n,I \\nThe Bridgman technique of purifying DAR-Si Q \\nwas discontinued dueto limited funds. The choice was made to continue crystal growth purification using the Czochralski technique due to its much higher degree of technical sophisti- \\n, t \\n<,cation. In the long-range, however, further development of \\nBridcjman purification technology is recommended since it could result \\nin lower-cost SoG-Si. \\nQ_ \\n3 70 \\nd \\'I i \\nD. Vacuum Evaporation \\n1. Background \\nCs It was suggested by JPL that Dow Corning attempt to purify silicon via evaporation \\nof impurities under vacuum, as indicated by Bradshaw and Mlavsky (17). \\nTo explore the feasibility of significantly decreasing the concentration of \\nimp,urities in MG-Si by vacuum evaporation, an \\nNRC, Model 2805, crystal puller was modified for vacuum operation. This unit permitted up \\nIJ to 12-hour operation a$ pressures in the range of 0.1-1 \\nx Torr. The pressure selected for experimental investigation was 0.2-0.4 x \\nlo-) Torr range. Experi- . . \\nmental pressures were chosen to be slightly above the G \\nvapor pressure of silicon at the particular melt temper- ature under study, thereby avoiding excessive loss of silicon \\n\\'which could result in actual concentration of impurities in the \\nmelt. \\n2. Experimental Procedure \\n* A sample of MG-Si was placed in a quartz crucible and loaded into the \\nfurngce. In the first \\nL\" experiment, the surface area of the molten silicon was \\n2 60 cm while the mass of the silicon charge was 450 g, \\n2 providing an area-to-mass ratio of 0.13 cm /g. After loading, the furnace was purged with argon and the charge was melted under an argon atmosphere (1 atm), Once molten, \\na silicon sample was withdrawn to provide a specimen for base-line impurity analysis. The chamber was then evacu- ated. Every three hours the furnace was back-filled with \\ni argon and the melt was resampled. \\n3. Results \\n1 c Three experiments were performed using \\n\\'4 different silicon area-to-mass ratios. Enission spectro- \\n. P scopic analyses of silicon sampled at 0, 3, and 6-hour \\n2 intervals appear in Table 25. No reduction in the con- \\n%-* centration of any impurity element is discernable. \\n-3 \\n71 r . J \\ni , \\n\\n0 \\n\\'r The variation in individual impurity analyses over a 6-h interval is well within the error of the analytical technique. The concentrations of the volatile impurities \\nY As, Ca, Sb, and Sn were below their detection limits. i \\na* This is< most likely due to the high temperatures MG-Si \\n1 \\nr is subjected to during its arc-furnace production. \\nI The silicon in the experimgnt performed at the area- to-mass ratio \\ndf Q.. 44 g/cm2 had a layer thickness of 0.7 \\nY:.i \\ncm. This was the mini,mum thickness attainable due to the surface tension of the \\nMG-Sic i; \\nIt was recommended that further work on MG-Si, \\n?, purification via vacuum evaporation be discontinued. This \\n<,-+ \\nI J! \\n! recommendation was made on the fact that absolutely no &-L Y \\nI evidence had been obtained suggesting any degree of MG-Si \\npurity improvement.

EVALUATION OF SOG-SI AS SOLAR CELLS \\nProper choice of raw materials allowed DAK-Si to be \\nw \\nproduced with low boron (7 ppma) and phosphorus (0.5 ppma) concentrations during only the last two months of the \\nk \\ncontract. This DAR-Si. was further processed, as indicated \\nW below, and supplied to two companies for limited evaluation as solar cells. \\nI 1: \\nSilicon from \\'experiment DAR-200-17 was purified in a i \\nCzochralski puller to produce polycrystalline SoG-Si. \\n- This material was then converted into single-crystalline \\n(100) silicon via a second Czochralski pull. T>e ingot ranged in resistivity from 0.19 ohm-cm at \\nthe seed end to 0.18 ohm-cm at the \\ntang end. Single-crystalline ingots \\ni \\nwere supplied to Applied Solar Energy Corp. (OCLI) and to , \\nARC0 Solar Tnc. for sawing into wafers and cell fabrication. D 1 \\nApplied Solar .Energy Corporation fabricated (18) twelve [ \\nsolar cells on wafers cut from the seed half of the 3-cm- * $ \\n;I \\ndiameter ingot.

Air-mass-zero 1 I \\nefficiencies after a SiO antireflection coating ranged from 4 \\n7.2 to 10.5:;, the average being 9.3:.

Applied Solar Energy Corporation I \\nestimated the average AMP efficiency to be 10.62, assuming it \\ni no limitation due to minority carrier diffusion length. \\ni \\nVery limited solar cell data were provided by ARCO ii !i Solar, Inc. on wafers cut from the tang half of the same i? \\n3-cm-diameter ingot. A standard process was used to produce 4 1\\' \\n1 \\n24 cells the output of which translated to AM1 effiencies b \\n,t \\nbetween 10.5 to 13.4% when AR coated (19,20). \\nEnhanced solar cell processing (18) by Applied Solar % \\nEnergy Corporation did not sf &gnif icantly improve cell performance.

RECOMMENDATIONS \\nC Further developnent of the Dow Corning $bcess for 5 \\nSoG-Si should continue at a pilot-plant scaBe based upon \\nY (1) the technical success demonstrated during this contract, \\n(2) the very low-cost potential, for the final product, and \\n(3) the commercially-available technology already ?xist- \\ning in industry that can be directly applied to the scale- up \\nof the two process steps. Pilot-plant-scale development must address two objectives: \\n(1) demonstration of technological feasibility on a scale and level of sophistication more closely approximating that \\nI of an actual plant; and (2) production of SoG-Si at a scale that will provide silicon at \\na cost low enough to allow the array manufacturer to \\ndrop his price, thereby opening markets Lor new applications. This will complete the circle \\nby \\n\" causing greater demand for silicon such that its price will .. \\ndrop further due to increased volume of production. \\ne The remaining recomendations\\'address details that must \\n\\\\\\\\ be accomplished for process scale-up. \\nA reliable analytical technique is required as a quality assurance tool for determining boron and \\n,, \\nphosphorus in quartz and carbon to a lower limit of about \\n0.1 ppmw. Analytical methods are not \\n7 sufficient at the 1 ppmw level. \\nQuartz sand, which is purer in boron than,vein \\n, 1, quartz, should be examined as a bettex source of \\nsilica for the carbothermic reduction process. \\n0 Greater control must be obtained over the production of carbon black pellets. \\nThis should be done either in-house by \\ntka;DAR-Si producer or directly at the manufacturer of carbon black itself. \\nh 0 More sophisti~ated;~~handling of raw materials must \\n- <[ &d be developed at th& DAR-Si pilot plant.

For example, , an estimate of uncertainty of ±60% has\\nbeen made for reactive HC in the South Coast Air Quality Manage-\\nment District (SCAQMD). However, this tit mate is currently not\\nverifiable by the SCAQMD.\\nBased on both factory and surveillance tests, motor vehicle\\nemissions of CO, HC and Nox have substantially decreased during\\nthe last decade. However, data taken by the California Air Resour-\\nces Board (GARB) indicate low correlation between emissions and\\nmileage. This report discusses the reasons for the large variabil-\\nity in data, and shows that an Inspectioti and Maintenance program\\nc.an,,cause a large decrease in this variability.\\nThe use of Gaussian statistics to analyze auto exhaust emission\\ndata is misleading in cases where the standard deviation is\\ngreater than the mean.\\nIn order to obtain meaningful \"reasonable further progress\" (RFP)\\ntrends, it may be necessary for the Congress to modify the Clean\\nAir Act to require that both annual regional emissions and their\\niincertainties be estimated. If Congress imposes such a require-\\nment, the funds which are required to determine these uncertainties\\ncould be authorized by the Congress or could be raised by either\\ninitia \"ting or increasing emission fees,\\n2.Uncertainties -in Air Quality Models\\nAir quality simulation models are subject tea \\tIn\\nmeteorological parameters, emissions inventories, rates of chemical.\\nreactions of the pollutants, measurements of ambient air quality,\\nand the mathematical model itself. For example, the uncertainty\\nin chemical kinetics is about :•50%. The uncertaiiities in emissions\\ninventories may be comparable. Presently thk- combined effect of\\nthese uncertainties is unknown. A Monte Carlo method for determin-\\ning the combined effect of the various uncertainties Is described.\\nv\\nThe credibility of photochemical air quality models, such as the\\nempirical kinetic modeling approach (RKMA) is severely limited by\\nthe accuracy and ,precisionof present measurement instruments for\\nmeasuring NMHC and NO.K.\\nThe prediction of the impact of transportation I systems on ambient\\nair quality is a statistical problem. At present the effect of\\nchanges in emissions from mobile sources is masked by the internal\\nerrors or uncertainties in the air quality simulation models.\\nSince these uncertainties are large, only substantial reductions\\nin RUC and NOx emissions can lead to reliable improvement in\\noxidant ambient air quality.\\n3. Managemelat Air Quality Standards\\nThe present Federal ambient air quality standard for ozone is\\nbased on human health effect. The standard is expressed in terms\\nof a maximum hourly average concentration not to be exceeded more\\nthan one day pe g:\\tHence, present ozone air quality planning\\nis based on a ra,o event. In the South Coast, Air Quality Manage-\\nment District this standard is violated abov .it 200 days per year,\\noften for many hour ,; a dad*. In other words, ,such violations are\\nby no means rare events. This a-ssc_-_-ment of air quiality . simulation\\nmodels shows that the models are poorly equipped to predict\\nrare events because of the large uncertainties in the data base.,\\nWe reconimend,that serious consideration be , given by the EPA to\\nreplac-ing t,y& present procedure for compliance with the ozone\\namibient air quality standard with an approach which is statisti-\\ncally robust. For example, a \"management standards\" approach\\ncould be used which would set up milestones on the way to clean air\\nin terms of hours per year that the Federal standard is exceeded.\\nIn those AQMD\\'sF -hatpresently violate the Federal standard ,by a\\nlarge margin, a reduction of 50% in the number of hours per,year\\nthat the Federal level is exceeded might be mandated for the period\\n1979-1983. An additional reduction of 75% in the remaining number\\nof hours per year that the Federal level is exceeded might be\\nmandated for the periot\\' 19831987. This approach would permit\\nstatisticall y sound feedback to air quality managers responsible\\nfor planning the required reductions in emissions of specific\\npollutants.J\\ni-vi\\n;f\\n^±I\\nCONTENTS \\n;^INTRODUCTION \\t...... . ........... . .................... 1-1\\n1,,.\\t1 \\'.I\\t STUDY \\tENVIRONMEN T,M . . . . . it . . . .. . .

This characterization examines uncertainties associated with\\nthe emission sources of air pollutants, meteorological influences,\\natmospher14:,chemistry, and air quality simulation models. This study\\nincludes 4V,\\' \\tof the use of air quality simulation models by\\nthree cities which have predominantly transportation-related sources of\\nair pollutants - Phoenix, Denver and Los Angeles. In summary, this\\nreport examines both the fundamr-4-1tal information base and the analy-\\ntical tools which area \\tto make air quality management decisions.\\nIn Section 1 of this report, a description of the post 1977\\namendments to the Clean Air Act, Institutional environment and its\\ninfluence on air quality management Is discussed, In addition, the\\napproach that was used in this study is presented. In Section 2, the\\ntechniques for astim- atin.- the emissions for mobile sources for a given\\nair basin are described. This section includes a discussion of exhaust\\nstandards, testing procedures, and transportation networks. In Section\\n3, a discussion of stationary :source emission factors, and emission\\ninventory systems is presented. Section 4 examines a spectrum of air\\nquality simulation models v1iich range from very simple to extremely\\ncomplex. Estimates of the uncertainties of the models are made. Section\\n5 presents information on both the accuracy of instruments for measur-\\ning ambient concentrations of NO., NMHC AND 03, and the implications\\nthis has on decision making. Air quality trends are also discussed,\\nSection 0 summarizes the report and contains our findings, conclusions\\nand recommendations.\\n1.1\\t STUDY ENVIRONMENT\\nThe Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 require the states to\\nsubmit plans which show that the regions within the state can attdin.\\nthe, primary ambient air quality standards by 1982. An eXL011.4ion to\\nDecember 31, 1987, may be obtained if the district cannot meet the\\nNational Primary Ambient Air Quality standards for photochemical o yi-\\ndents and/or carbon monoxide by 1982. (Section 1.7.2.A.2 of CAA). It\\nshould be noted that the assumption is made by the Congress that it Is\\n,possible for all areas of the country to reach the y \\tAmbient\\nAir Quality Standards by either 1982 or 1987. In order to insure that\\nthe various districts and states make all reasonable attempts to reach\\nthese standards, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1.977 have put teeth\\ninto the Clean Air Act. That is, there are very severe sanctions that\\napply to the districts that do not attain the Primary Ambient Air Qual-\\nity Standards by these dates. Section I.I.O.A.2.1 provides that after\\nJune 30, 1979, no majo-^\\' stationary sources shall be constructed in\\nareas for which the State Implenetation Plan has not been approved.\\n1-1\\n6k_\"\\'\\nOther discretionary sanctions to the Administrator of EPA may al\\ninvoked. The South Coast Air Quality Management Plan states tha\\nure to implement these measures could result in Federal enforcem\\nimpositions of sanctions against the funding and approval of all\\nFederally funded projects, particularly transportatibn and waste\\ntreatment projects.\" (Ref. 1-1.) Because these sanctions could\\nto billions of dollars in some areas, they are taken very seriou\\nboth the Air Quality Managment Districts and the states. This b\\nresulted in the creation of comprehensive air quality management\\nfor many districts. For some districts, this is the first time\\never had a plan that shows how they could attain the Primary Amb\\nAir Quality Standards.\\n1.1.1\\tState Implementation Plans (SIP)\\nSince the Clean Air Act was amended in August of 1977, the\\ndeadline of June 31, 1979, for State Implementation approval presented\\na formidable schedule to the three areas examined in this study, Phoe-\\nnix, Denver, and the south coast air basin of California. The schedule\\nwas made particularly difficult by the requirement of Sect.1-c-14 , 121 which\\nstates\\t the state shall provide a satisfactory process of con-\\nsultation with general purpose local governments, designated organiza-\\ntions of elected officials of local governments . . .\" In the case of\\nthe Los Angeles area, this required that a draft of the Air Quality\\nManagement Plan be circulated for public review in October 1978 in order\\nto allow revision, ,; to be made before the Plan was submitted to the\\nCalifornia Air Resources Board in January 1979. Hence, very little time\\nwas left for negotiations between the South Coast Air Quality Manage-\\nment Distl\\'ict and the -Southern California Association of Governments,\\nand the California Air Resources Board in order to finalize the o i- r.-\\nquality management plan as it would appear in the State Tmplementation\\nPlan.\\nThe complexity of the political process requiring local par-\\ntieipation is indicated in the following: \"SCAV, is a voluntary regional\\norganization composed of six Southern California counties--Imperial,\\nLos Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura--and approx-\\nimately 130 member cities within these counties\" (Ref. 1-2.).\\nCongress recognized many of the uncertainties in air\\nquality management by requiring that annual reports be made which esti-\\nmate progress toward achieving the national primary ambient air quality\\nstandards. It was thought that progress and problems could be identified\\non a yearly basis, and hence plans changed in order to attain the air\\nquality according to a timetable. The Clean Air Act defines reasonable\\nfurther progress as \". \\'. . annual incrementpil reductions in emissions\\nof the applicable air pollutant (including substantial reductions in the\\nearly years following approval or promulgation of planned provisions\\nI I . and regular reductions thereafter which are sufficlont in the\\njudgment of the administrator, to provide for attainment of the appli-\\ncable National Ambient Air Quality Standard by the date required in\\nSection 172(a).\"\\n1-2\\nAccording to a draft of the annual report in the South\\nCoast Air Quality Management Plan dated April 11, 1980, p. viii, \"the\\nEPA recognized that some measures cannot result in immediate reductions\\nand will accept a lag in decreases at the straight line rate for the\\nfirst one or two years after 1979. Figure 1-1 shows an RFP schedule\\nacceptable to EPA. It is important to note that RFP is measured by\\nannual emissions reductions, not air quality.\"\\n1.1.2\\tEPA/DOT Interface\\nTransportation systems have a large impact on the quality\\nof the environment.. One of the major considerations when planning a\\nnew system is the effect on the quality of the air. This necessitates\\na close coordination of the requirements of both the Department of\\nTransportation and the Environmental Protection Agency. Pursuant to the\\nPresident\\'s request, a Memorandum of Understanding was approved by the\\nDOT and EPA in June 1978. It states that:\\nIn order to effectively achievee the objectives of the 1977\\nClean Air Act Amendments, the DOT and Environmental Pro-\\ntection Agency agree that the transportation-related air\\nquality planning requirements r,`^f EPA will be integrated\\nwith the transportation planning process administered by\\nthe DOT. Closer integration of the planning requirements\\nof DOT and EPA will ensure the timely consideration of air\\nquality concerns and will reduce potentially duplicative,\\nover-lapping and inconsistent. \\tat the state and\\nlocal level.\\nThis mandates a significant DOT involvement in transportation/air qual-\\nity impact assessment.\\nA model which could accuratel y predict air transport and\\ntransformation phenomena would be an invaluable tool for understanding\\nthe effect of a proposed transportation change. In fact, such a model\\nis necessary to satisfy the analysis requirements of the various high-\\nway transportation acts and clean air acts which relate to the legal.\\nresponsibilities of the Secretary of Transportation to curb the impact\\nof transportation-generated air pollution on the environment.\\nThe adequacy of present air pollutant emission and air dis-\\npersion models for analyzing the mesoscale and regional air pollution\\nimpact of transportation systems has been questioned by the Department\\nof Transportation. Data from such models are -required to perform the\\nanalyses Mandated by the various highway tian;sportation acts and the\\nClean Air Act Ameadments (CAAA) of 1977. In particular, under the CAAA,\\ncertain states must include such analyses in their 1982 State, Implemen-\\ntation Plans (SIP\\'S).\\n1-3\\n_..\\t.. \\n1[._..\\t . I\\t 1\\t 11\\nThe EPA recognizes the present state of air quality models\\nand has initiated-a comprehensive program to validate selected grid\\nand/ter trajectory air quality simulation models (AQSM\\'s) for five\\ncities:: Denver, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Tulsa, and St. Louis. The\\nprogram is to provide user agencies with a set of validated AQSM\\'s\\nwhich have been jointly (EPA/DOT) approved for preparing their 1982\\nSIP\"s.\\nThe necessity for joint approval is indicated by the memo-\\nrandum of understanding between DOT and EPA, June 1978, which \"estab-\\nlished a DOT/EPA coordination process to reduce potentially overlapping\\nand inconsistent activities and provide for a single Federal decision\\non local clean air proposals\".\\nTo provide the DOT with information relevant to its\\nresponsibilities, this wont characterizes the transportation sources\\'\\ninventories (TSI\\'s) and assesses their impact on the air quality\\nmanagement process.\\n1.1.3\\tNational. Commission on Air Quality\\nThe 1977 Amendments to the Clean Air Act were so extensive\\nthat the Congress decided to form a National Commission on Air Quality\\nto examine the pros and cons of meeting or not meeting the requirements\\nof the 1977 Amendments. The charter of the National Commission on Air\\nQuality is spelled out In detail in Section 323 of the Clean Air Act.\\nBASEYEAR\\nEMISSIONS—......RFP TARGET\\nIN PLANEMISSIONS\\nLn\\t ••..,\\n.__. ^._ NAAOS AGHIEVEMENT\\n80\\t 81\\t 82\\t 83\\nYEAR\\nFig. 1-1.

A literature review\\nof emissions inventories and air quality simulation models (AQSMs) was\\n_performed. The pollutants included in this review were NO., 03, HC\\'s,\\n502, TSP, CU and Pb. A background on the Federal. view of current issues\\nand techniques of air quality management was obtained through site\\nvisits to the Environmental Protection Agency\\'s centers at Research\\nTriangle Park, N.C.; Durham, N.C.; Washington, D.C.; and San Francisco,\\nCA. In addition, a visit was made to the headquarters of the National\\nCommission on Air Quality. During the,4a1 ^- visits, discussions took place\\nwith air quality modelers, regulators and planners concerning the\\ndetailed manner in which AQSMs are used. After these site visits, a\\nseries of discussions took place between jPL and Environmental Quality\\nLaboratory (EQL) personnel cou: \\xadiernin g the sensitivity of the outputs\\nof AQSMs to the transportation source inventory (TSI) inputs, station-\\nary source inputs, and other pertinent factors.It\\n1-5\\nk.i.\\nZ\\nO\\nOf-U\\nO\\nwV\\nM\\nO\\nw\\nmQ1One study goal was to determine whether significant gaps or\\ninadequacies existed in present approaches to transportation source\\ninventories, stationary source inventories, meteorological factors\\nand air quality simulation models. Another goal was to recommend correc-\\ntive actions which would mitigate the effects of the gaps. One of thebest sources of knowledge of current issues and gaps in air quality\\nmanagement are the state and local air quality managers. In order to\\nobtain a sampling of their views of air quality issues we talked with\\na variety of state and local organizations which are active in air qual-ity management. In particular, we focused our attention on personnel\\nwith responsibility for the air quality management regions surrounding\\nPhoenix, Arizona; Denver, Colorado; and Las Angeles (South Coast Air\\nQuality Management District),\\nThese regions were chosen because most of their pollution\\nsources are related to mobile sources (Refs. 1-1, 1-2, 1-3 and 1-4).\\nThe percentage of total emissions due to mobile sources is shown in\\n\\'Pig. 1-2 for these regions. Data are presented for hydrocarbons (HC),\\noxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), total suspended partic-\\nulate (TSP), and sulfur oxides (SO X). Over 90% of the CO originates\\nfrom mobile sources for these regions. For the Denver region, 85% of\\nthe HC and 76% of the TSB` are from mobile sources.\\n= S \\'H COAST AIR BASIN\\n\"\\t I.W A \\tGo\\t TSP\\t SOX\\nFig. 1-2. Mobile Sources Percent of Total Emissions\\nBased on State Implementation Plans for\\nSouth Coast Air Basin, Denver, and Phoenix\\n1-6\\nWe visited with two groups in Arizona, the Department of\\nHealth Services, and the Arizona Department of Transportation. Th*\\nArizona Department of Health Services includes an Environmental Health\\nServices Division, which has a bureau of air quality control. The site\\nvisit to Phoenix, Arizona, was enhanced by the Clean Air Conference\\nthat the United States Conference of Mayors held in that city. In\\nDenver, Colorado, we visited with representatives from the Denver\\nRegional Council of Governments, the Colorado Department of Health,\\nand the Colorado Division of Highways. In Colorado, the Air Pollution\\nCor;rol Division is within the Colorado Department of Health.\\nOur major interactions during this study took place in the\\nCalifornia area. Visits were made to the California Air Resources\\nBoard to get the state view of the State Implementation Plan process,\\nAn extensive set of interactions took place between our staff and the\\nstaffs of both the Southern California Association of Governments\\njSCAG) and the Southern California Air Quality Management District\\n(SCAQMD). Many of the ideas that are expressed in this report came\\nfrom the staffs of the agencies cited above. However, some are solely\\nthe responsibility of the authors.\\nIt should be noted that the Clean Air Conference held by\\nthe United States Conference of Mayors zn Los Angeles, August 23-24,\\n1979, provided useful background information for this study. Some of\\nthe material from both the L.A. and the Phoenix conferences will be\\ndescribed later in the report (RRfs. 1-4, 1-5, 1-6).\\n1.3\\t BACKGROUND ON AIR QUALITY SIMULATION MODELS\\nIn general, Air Quality Simulation Models (AQSM\\'s) are usod\\nto relate the emissions of air pollutants from a variety of sources to\\nthe ground level concentration of each air pollutant. These models range\\nin complexity from the \"back of an envelope calculation,\" to extremely\\nelaborate computer simulation models that run at a speed approximately\\nequal to the speed at which\\'the air pollution reactions take place in\\nthe atmosphere. In other words, the simulation of orw day of air qual-\\nity might require several hours of computer running time. The general\\ncomponents of an air quality simulation model are shown in Fig. 1-3.\\nThe more complex air quality simulation models attempt to account for\\nthe sources of air pollutants, trieir transportation and dispersion by\\nthe winds, the chemical transformations that take place, and the\\nremoval mechanisms that affect them.\\nThe sources include both man-made sources of air pollutants,\\nsuch as stationary power plants or mobile emissions from automobiles,\\nand geogenic sources, i.e., sources directly from the earth. An impor-\\ntant source of pollutants are those that are transported into an air\\nquality region from outside that region. The meteorological component in\\nFig. 1-3 includes physical parameters such as temperature, the height\\nof an inversion layer, the wind field, the turbulence associated with\\nthe wind, surface topography and surface roughness. Cloud cover affects\\nthe amount of radiation coming from the sun; hence it influences both\\nthe temperature distribution and the chemical reactions.k\\n1-7\\nCHEMISTRY\\nSOURCES OF \\tMATH:MATICAL \\t COMPUTED\\nAIR\\tMODEL \\t CONCENTRATIONS\\nPOLLUTANTS \\t1^\\tK\\nMETEOROLOGY\\nFig. 1-3. Major Components of Air Quality Simulation\\nModels\\nThe box labeled chemistry at the top of the diagram in Fig. 1-3,\\nwould, for example, include:\\n(1)Photochemical reactions which cause oxides of\\nnitrogen and hydrocarbons to react to produce ozone\\nand other components of photochemical smog.\\n(2)Homogeneous processes involving gaseous reactions.\\n(3)Heterogeneous processes involving gases and\\nparticulates or aeros4 s.\\n(4)Removal processes surface deposition by contact,\\nrainout, etc.\\nThe sources of the air pollutants, the meteorology, and\\nthe chemistry are put into a mathematical model which is an analytical\\ndescription of the interaction of these components. The output of the\\nmodel is the concentration of air pollutants. These concentrations may\\nbe considered a constant over a region in the simple models or as a\\nfunction of three spatial coq;,\"dinates in the more complicated models.\\nThe above fairly complex type of model contrasts to the simple models\\nused in rollback type calculations.\\n1-8\\na\\nWarren B. Johnso,a, in fief. 1 =7, provides a summary of some\\nof the reasons for air quality simulation models.\\nQuestions such as the following must then be considered:\\n9 What are the relative contributions of various\\ncurrent or planned source categories or individual\\nsources to ground level concentrations?\\n• What will be the effect of a reduction in\\nemissions of one of the reactive pollutants\\ninvolved in producing P secondary pollutant?\\n0 What air quality improvements can be achieved\\nthrough indirect controls; i.e., changes in the\\nsource distribution` in space and time?\\nThe only hope for answering such \\'what if . . .V questions\\nlies in air quality simulation models which furnish a\\nscientific basi.i for decisions leading to least-cost air\\nquality improvement. \\t u\\nTo assist in addressing these questions, the current usage patterns\\nand the uncertainties essiciated with the following air quality simula-\\ntion models are examined in this report.\\n(1)Rollback.\\n(2)Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach (EKMA).\\n(3)Photochemical dispersion.\\nEach of those models requires a knowledge of the sources of pollutants\\nin the area under study, i.e., each of these models requires an emis-\\nsions inventory.\\n1.4\\t EMISSION INVENTORIES\\nEach city and region of the United States is characterized\\nby an extremely complicated set of activities. These activities will\\nvary from region to region and city to city. These activities are\\nassociated with the emiss,;ons of air pollutants. Hence to keep track\\nof the emissions in a given area, a system is required which categorizes\\nthe pollutants emitted by species, location, rate of emission, and other\\npertinent characteristics. The structure of an emissions inventory is\\nshown in Fig. 1-4.-This inventory is based on the structure used in the\\nNational Emissions Data System (NEDS) (Ref. 1-8.)\\n1-9\\n11\\nThe primary breakdown in the emiosions sources is-^rhether\\nthe sources are stationary or mobile. Stationary sources can be con-\\nsidered as point sources where large amounts of pollutants come out of\\na single smokestack or complex of smokestackb Area sources are referred\\nto as either cainbustion area sources or nonco*\\'ustion area sourcei. Typ-\\nical area combustion sources are residences, commercial establishments,\\ninstitutional establishments such as schools, hospitals, public build-\\nings, and some small industrial. establishments. Noncombustion area\\nsources may emit hydrocarbons such as vapors from gasoline storage and\\nhandling by distributors and service stations, dry cleaners, painting,\\ndegreasing, and application of asphalt to roofing and pavement.\\nThe National Emission. Data System divides point stationary\\nsources into two categories, internal combustion and external. combustion.\\nExternal combustion, as shown in Fig. 1- ,4, is subdivided into fuel com-\\nbustion, Industrial processes and solid waste disposal. Examples of\\nfuel combustion sources include residential sources, el.ectricFal genera-\\ntion sources, industrial fuel sources, etc. Industrial processes include\\nchemical manufacturing, primary metal manufacturing, secondary metal\\nmanufacturing, etc. The mobile sources are subdivided, as shown in\\n\\'rig_ 1.-4, into land vehicles, sh i ps and aircraft. The land vehicles\\nare broken down into gasoline and diesel fueled vehicles. Included\\nunder: diesel vehicles are trains, off-highway vehicles, light duty\\nvehicles and heavy duty vehicles.\\nEMISSION\\nSOURCES\\nAREA \\t POINTMOBILE\\nSTATIONARY \\t STATIONARY\\nSOURCESSOURCES1SOURCES\\n_r\\n•\\nINTERNAL EXTERNAL LAND\\tSHIPS\\tAIRCRAFT\\nCOMBUSTION COMBUSTION VEHICLES\\nFUEL\\nCOMBUSTIONINDUSTRIALITID\\nPROCESST\\nPf GASOLINE \\t DIESEL \\t PISTON\\t JET\\nOAL\\nRESIDENTIAL- CHEMICAL \\t\\n\"OFF HIGHWAY \\tRAILROADS s\\nMANUFACTURING\\nELECTRICAL\\nGENERATIONPRIMARY\\nMETALLIGHTVEHICLES \\tOFF HIGHWAY\\nINDUSTRIAL SECONDARY HEAVY VEHICLES \\tLIGHT VEHICLESFUELMETAL\\nCOMMERCIAL- FOODIAGRICULTURAL HEAVY VEHICLES\\nINSTITUTIONALPETROLEUMFUELINDUSTRY\\n••• •0♦\\nF1 1-4.

Data used in this section are from\\nmany tests following the Federal Test Procedures. Test results include\\nthose from both factory and surveillance testing. Idle and evaporative\\nemissions are included. An analysis is performed to examine the influ-\\nence of variability and uncertainties on emissions as a function of\\nmodel year and odometer mileage. It compares the data from in-use bars\\nobtained by EPA and California Air Resources Board. In particular, the\\ndata from ;as received\" cars and repaired cars are used to demonstrate\\nthe potential emissions reduction obtainable through Inspection and\\nMaintenance. Finally, this section identifies characteristics of\\ntransportation network models.\\nMobile sources of .,primary interest in this study include\\nLight Day Vehicles (LDV) because they are the predominant source of\\nemissions of 11C. CO and N ,(),. Emissions of HC, CO and NOX from LDV\\ncause major increa.gos in ambient air pollution throughout the United\\nStates, Cities such as Denver, Phoenix and Los Angeles are particularly\\nimpacted by the emissions from mobile sources. These cities are used\\nas examples in the assessment of the emissions from LDV sources, In\\nparticular, test results obtained from California cars, high altitudecars (DenvL3r), and other cars tested throughout the United States are\\nused to examine uncertainties and variability in the test data. The\\nstudy compares data from several data bases with the appropriate vehicle\\nemission standards. In addition, the reader is appraised of the problems\\nassociated with interpreting and using the test results for projecting\\nfuture emissions and planning strategies. The study reviews the sur-\\nvell anoo testing currently underway. Even though the results point\\nconclusively to substantial decreases in the emission levels in the\\nnowor LDV\\'s. the\\' \\tin the data is still large. This study\\ndoes not examine the technical adequacy of emissions control systems;\\nhowever, it, does compare the test results on cars for model years\\n1970-1979. Newer model year data demonstrate that the use of catalyst\\non LDV\\',s Is an effective control for emissions. Other test results such\\nas omi8sion during fdlo testing and during evaporation tests are also\\ndiscussed to show both the uncertainties and the importance of these\\nemissions as ma or sources during the typical use of a vehicle.\\n2.1\\t MOBILE SOURCES WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE\\nThey\\tsources work breakdown structure presented in\\nFig. 1-4 and proviously described in a general manner identifies al.1\\nof the Important mobile sources.

Summary of Changes in the federal LDV\\nStandards #Since 1967\\n2-4\\nThe State of California has established exhaust emission\\nstandards which, in many cases, are more stringent than the Federal\\nstandards. This was done in an attempt to alleviate the serious photo-\\nchemical smog problems which impact several of California\\'s heavily\\npopulated air basins. For example, the South Coast Air Basin, which\\ncontains approximately 10 million people, exceeds the national primary\\nambient air quality standard for ozone about 200 days per year. The\\nCalifornia standards from 1966 to 1983 are shown in Appendix A. Many\\ntests have been performed to determine the \"in use\" performance of LDV\\nemission control systems. Both factory and field test method and pro-\\ncedures are described in parts B.1 and B.2 of Appendix B of this\\nreport. The exhaust test data show considerably variability. In many\\nchases the standard deviation of the data is approximately equal to or\\ngreater than the mean of the data. The relative contributions of\\nvehicle, driver, ambient conditions and exhaust gas measurement instru-\\nments are described in part B.2.3. It is of interest to note, for\\nexample, that ambient conditions have a small influence on variability\\nof HC and NOx emissions, whereas they are the largest contributor to\\nCO variability.\\nThe California Air Resources Board has performed a set of\\ntests of the emissions of cars to determUle both their \"as received\"\\nexha 1st characteristics, and their characteristics after repair accord-\\ning to a protocol. The data are examined for given model years as a\\nfunction of odometer reading. The data are statistically summarized\\nby determining both the best straight line fit of the data (exhaust vs\\nmileage) and the correlation of the fit. The correlation coeffi<<.ients\\nfound are less than or equal to 0.3. A detailed discussion of the CARB\\nresults is presented in part B.3 of Appendix B. The repair procedures\\nproduced substantial reductions in emissions. Figure 2-5 shows both the\\n\"\"as received\" exhaust characteristics and t-iie \"after repair\" character-\\nistics. It should be noted that the average car does not meet the\\nemission standard after approximately 20,000 miles, even after the car\\nhas been repaired.\\nThe value of an inspection and mai.n 1,tenance (I/M) program is\\nalso shown in Fig. 2-5. If the I/M procedures q;te performed every 10,000\\nmiles, then exhaust emission; are reduced to tike \"after repair\" straight\\nline. The assumption is made that the axhaust emissions then increase\\nwith mileage, with the same slope as to the \"as received\" cars. Hence,\\nwith an I/M program, the emissions follow the saw-toothed pattern shown\\nin Fig. 2-5. The emissions reductions associated with I/M can be sub-\\nstantial. For example, the crossed-hatched area represents the emissions\\nreductions obtainable with I/M betweeti the car\\'s 50,000th and 60,000th\\nmile. In this example this emissions saving is about 45%.\\nThe point demonstrated by the sawtoothed curve is that\\nlittle deviation will occur per the average car if repaired systemati-\\ncally. In a quantitative assessment considering the CARB data and\\nCalifornia standards the NOx and CO standard might be met by the avornge\\n1975 through 1979 cars having an accumulation of 50,000 to 70,000\\nmiles. Even with I/M, the HC emissions on the averagm 1975-1976 and\\n1977-1979 cars would not be within the standards but the improvement\\n2-5\\nV1\\nz\\n0\\nVi\\nIs\\nXUj\\nP\\'r I—\\n- - -EMISSION STANDARD\\n10\\t 30\\t 50\\t 70\\t 90\\nODOMETER READING QWLES X 103)\\nFig. 2-5, Model of Potential EmisAon Reduction Due\\nto I/M versus Odometer Reading\\nwould be significant, For HC emissions the 1975-1976 and 1977-1979\\naverage cars would exceed the standard by a factor of 2 at 70,000 miles.\\nThis estimate i s based on using AP-42 2 mcthodolog0 and\\nassuming every car in the 11. S. will be built aecording to existing\\nstandards including those to go into effect for 1981 models. It further\\nassumes that the average car will reach its 50,000-mile point before\\nfour years of age.\\nThe improvement in California cars is shown , in Figs. 2,6,\\n2-7 and 2-8, based on data presented in Ref. 2-5. These figures sbov\\nthe mean exhaust emissions as a function of model year. In the figures\\n(see Fig. 2-6 for example), the number of cars in the sample as well as\\nthe 110 deviation on the test results is shown. The rharacteristic,\\ntrend in the data indicates that the newer model ears are emitting less\\npollutants. However, for some years, especially for CO emissions (see\\nFig. 2-7) the deviations associated with the newer cars are as large\\nas those of earlier model years.\\n9\\nt ^r,\\n410 i\\ni\\nEd T 3.0\\nQ\\nNN „;\\nI \\t(53j\\ni2.0(57)\\nx^ PERCENT VEHICLES\\nzMEETING STD CALIF STD ? 1977\\nr\\t1.0 CALIF HC STD 18%\\t 22896 \\t (72)_\\n13.3% \\t 26.4% \\t 43.4%\\n0\\n72 73 74\\t 75\\t 76^77 \\t78\\nMODEL YEAR\\nFig.\\t2-6,HC Mean Emissions and Standard Deviations\\nversus Model Year of California Cars\\nII\\n2-7\\n\\\\\\t\\'60\\nm\\n^40\\n- »o\\nm^^\\nop\\nm\\nu\\n^\\'\\n\\'\\nFig. 2-7.

The results further support the need for developing\\neffective 1/M programs for in-use LDV (and other vehicles). As an\\nexample, Figs. 2-9 and 2-10 show results that demonstrate the signifi-\\ncant improvement in relatively new cars that have been tested as\\nreceived and then tested after restorative maintenance.

The Los Angeles cars\\nshowed that of the remaining cars that failed, almost 1/2 of those passed\\nafter restorative maintenance.\\nThis large a percentage pass of Los Angeles cars before\\nmaintenance is indicative of the more stringent set of certification\\nrequirements that the vehicles must pass to qualify as a California car.\\nBased on these test results (Ref. 2-4), the percent of\\nemission component malperformance is tabulated in Table 2-1 for compari-\\nson with the allowed maintenance of California cars according to the\\nI/M procedures. In addition, the resu,,ts of examining the percentage\\nemission increases due to various maladjustments atl disablements on\\nthe 1975 and 1976 vehicles are shown in Table 2-2.

Thus this section has discussed the data base\\nfor determining what the emissions for LDV\\'s are. An equally important\\nconsideration is to determine both the location and time at which the\\nemissions take place. These estimates are made th\\'xough the use of trans-\\nportation network models, which forecast travel demand as a function of\\nestimated urban and suburban activity. A discussion of the techniques\\nused in these transportation models is presented in part B.4 of\\nAppendix B.\\nBy combining the exhaust gas emissions information by model\\nyear, type of vehicle, etc., with the estimates of the location of the\\nvehicles as a function of time of day, estimates of the spatial and\\ntemporal distribution of emissions from mobile sources can be made. Of\\ncourse these emissions must be added to the emissions from stationary\\nsources to obtain estimates of the complete spatial and temporal distri-\\nbution of emissions. Stationary source emissions are discussed in the\\nfollowing section in order to provide information on the current status\\nof estimating the emissions from stationary sources.\\nTable 2-1.

In particular, this section examines the dominating sta-\\ntionary sources and compares their emissions with those from mobile\\nsources for the South Coast, Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD),\\nDenver and Phoenix. The assessment of pollutant emissions from the sta-\\ntionary sources is needed for transportation planning in order to insure\\neffective control strategies which satisfy ambient air pollutant stand-\\nards. An effective assessment of pollutants from stationary sources\\nmust consider both the temporal and spatial distributions of the source\\nemissions, and the uncertainties of these estimates.\\n3.1\\t WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE\\nStationary sources that significantly influence total pol-\\nlutant emission inventory are outlined in Fig. 1-4. Both area and point\\nsources are identified. The detailed listing outlines only the combus-\\ntion point sources because of their dominance of stationary emissions.\\nIt should be noted that all significant sources of air pollutant emis-\\nsions are considered in the development of an emissions data base for\\neach air quality region. Each source is evaluated in order to determine\\nits relative contribution — A comparison of the total emissions of par-\\nticulates, S02, NO X, HC and CO for the United States is presented in\\nTables 3-1 and 3-2 (Ref. 3-1). The comparison in Table 3-2 indicates\\nsubstantial emissions of HC and NO X come from both stationary and mobile\\nsources. Fig. 1-2 shows the percent of total emissions from mobile\\nsources for the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD),\\nDenver and Phoenix. From this data, it is seen that each of these\\nregions has its own stationary source pollutant concerns. For example,\\nin the SCAQMD, about 85% of the SO X and 55% of the TSP is contributed by\\nstationary sources.\\n3-1\\nTable, 3-1.

An examination is presented of how these\\nuncertainties affect (1) the mobile sources emissions inventories and\\nmodeling needed to predict ambient air quality and (2) the regulations\\nof the pollutants from stationary and mobile sources. Furthermore, an\\nappraisal of the existing data on stationary sources can be used to\\ndetermine how 1uncertain the data might be and yet be effective for\\nanalyzing a given air quality region. In order to develop and verify\\nair quality models, certain regions may require considerably more data\\nthan others. For example, the overall impact of all pollutant sources\\nin the SCAQMD requires a considerably larger data base than that appro-\\npriate for Phoenix. In the case of Phoenix, a simj^le model analysis\\nand knowledge of stationary point sources and their small contributions \\t 4\\nto CO and HC Is adequate for developing requirements and demonstrating\\ncompliance with regulations.\\n3.1.1\\t Point Sources\\nMl-11te major stationary point sources are fossil fuel util-\\nities and Industrial plants. These sources generally have specific\\noperating patterns and resultant emission histories. Knowing these\\npatterns, daily or hourly emissions can be estimated on the basis of\\nannual emissions. The yearly or hourly emissions from these sources are\\ntypically either based on measured actual emissions used to derive the\\nneeded inputs or estimated by emission modeling techniques. Emissions\\ndata derived from these approaches, 0 e.g., using long-term average\\nemission estimates for determining hourly emissions from stationary\\nsources, are frequently highly uncertain.\\nii\\n3.1.2\\t Area Sources\\nThe major stationary area sources that produce pollutants\\nthrough combustion include residences, commercial, institutional and\\nsmall manufacturing establishments. These sources burn fuels primarily\\nfor source heating, steam generating, (=king, and burning wastes. Again\\nthese sources exhibit patterns that vary diurnally, seasonally and with\\nthe ambient environment. Peaks of fuel consumption occur over a 1-3 hour\\nperiod with different peaks from different sources. Knowing these pat-\\nterns is essential to accurately estimating emissions from each of the\\nidentified areas.A\\nThe degree of knowledge of the emission sources determines\\nthe accuracy of the estimates. One current way of developing an emis-\\nsions inventory for stationary sources is to apply emission factors\\nwhich are characteristics of the combustion equipment. The emissions are\\ndetermined by multiplying the emission factor by the quantities of fuel\\nconsumed, The accuracy of this type of estimate may be limited by a lack\\nof knowledge of the concentration of the pollutants in the fuel.\\n3-3\\n3.2\\t STATIONARY SOURCES EMISSION FACTORS\\nStationary sources emission factors have been compiled by\\nEPA and are tabulated in the current revision of AP-42 and supplements\\n(Ref, 3-2). This compilation\\'of air pollutant emission factors contains\\nemission data obtained from source tests, mareri;i balance studies\\nand engineering estimates. The factors are continuously under revision\\nto improve the emissions factor data and its accuracy. Extensive com-\\npilations of factors for stationary sources are included. The lack of\\nagreement among the investigators regarding data formatting, the short7\\ncomings in measurements, and incomplete sets of measured data requiresi,`,\\nvarious assumptions to be made in order to compile the factors\\n(Ref. 3-2). The emission factors are current best estimates which\\nqualitatively identify the uncertainties A the data set. However, they\\noften do not provide for establishing upper or lower limits on the\\nestimates. The uncertainty errors are expected to be important when\\npredictions of ambient air quality in various regions are used to plan\\nstrategies. While the uncertainty may not affect establishing the qual-\\nification of a single stationary source lender average emission condi-\\ntions in order to meet the federal and/or State standards, it will\\ninfluence ambient air quality if the claim is that all stationary\\nsources met the standards based on average emission factors.\\nPracticable test procedures are needed to demonstrate that\\nstationary sources will meet the regulations based on both the source\\nand air quality standards. Test procedures must be established and\\ndemonstrated to produce sufficiently accurate measurement of stationary\\nsources. The measurements serve as an input to the models for,.,;irediet-\\ning an6ient air quality. \\t f/\\nThe uncertainties in the methods for measuring the consti-\\ntuents in the ambient air are discussed in Section 5. The current\\nmeasurements for SCAB (LA), Denver and Phoenix indicate numerous viola-\\ntions of the standards for many of the pollutants (Refs. 3-3, 3-4 and\\n3-5). In particular, stationary sources account for most of the particu-\\nlates violations in SCAB. for TPS the violations were so drastic\\'in 1976\\nin SCAB that the uncertainty on the measurements was not important.\\nHowever, for other contaminants, the data for SCAB in Table 3-3 shows\\nthat measurement uncertainty may be crucial in demonstrating that the\\nstandard is satisfied. In order to evaluate the air quality* of the\\nregion, the emissions measurements and estimates must be correlated\\nwith the air quality measurements at the network stations in each\\nregion. This is being done in many of the areas, and uncertainties in\\nthe measured data and modeled results have been revealed, The impor-\\ntance of this correlation has been identified by EPA in the workshop on\\nTtequirements for Non-Attainment Area Plans. The basic areas identified\\ni\\'or further work include need for more data and better models.

These\\nsummary tabJes provide comparisons of the relative percentage contri-\\nbution and resultant Importance of stationary sources vs other sources\\nof emissions. For the SCAB, an effective stationary sources emissions\\ninventory system is necessary for all pollutants except CO throughout\\nthe next 10 years because of their significant contributions. The\\nreasonable further progress anticipated involves RHC reductions of 1/3\\nand NOx reductions of 1/10 of the current amounts emitted.\\n\\'rile total reductions required must be examined critically\\nto sort out the relative importance of stationary sources. Then the\\nlarge stationary source contributors must be estimated, including the\\nexpected uncertainties in the emissions estimates measurements.\\n3.3.2\\t Denver System\\nDenver has had the same constraints as SCAQMD in predict-\\ning air quality levels, namely:\\n(1)Availability of meteorological, emissions and\\nmonitored air quality data.\\n(2)Development or access to models and modeling\\ntechnologies necessary for the level of sophisti-\\ncation needed by Denver.\\nAs described in Ref. 3-8 the analysis tools have been\\ngreatly facilitated by using the Systems Applications Inc. (SAI) Denver\\nmodel for predicting CO and 03. However, at the time of the study in\\nlate 1978 the reliability of models (SAL and Climatological Dispersion\\nModel) to predict the reliability of NO2 accurately has not been demon-\\nstrated quantitatively because the reactive properties of the NOx is not\\naccommodated.\\n3-6\\nN\\n1.1\\nro\\nr-!\\nro\\nG\\n.J\\nb\\ntGd\\nU:\\nr-3\\nr--t\\n.r{\\nw\"C1\\nG\\nO.H\\n41\\nroJJ\\ntli\\nbLa\\ns\\nU\\n\\'O\\nu\\nG\\nH\\nroww a N ^, .c a c\\nro o .fl v; 0o o a\\nas H -, -\\'\\nc;\\nCP: a G4\\nC14\\nN\\nA H p.+\\nON r .t O a\\n.-; rn Co O O\\nO O\\nDC T@ H\\nO\\nM\\n,z ,7,1.4 M M 00 00\\n\\'J M Cl) cy?\\nH A\\n,a c14 r+ r, o a\\n° °o 0 p cel Lr)\\nSC s,e H •-, \"^\\na_\\np ^^y+ 1.0C14 -4\\nra N N O O\\nw\\nOOa\\nC.)\\n1\\nr+ m N .7\\nO ^ N %0 u1 ^\\nH p r^ co 00\\na Na r^ O\\n44\\t4\\n0p M cn + O\\na\" E-4 -\\nLr) 00 r- a\\nUw 1\\tN\\n0It\\tcJ M u1 O\\nVS O t ^\\' 00 U\\'1 M\\nZ >4 r + 00 00 r, tiON\\nO 4 Lr) co N 110\\nH A r\\' `\\n^ v1 OQ N ttl O\\n4-4 ,\\nO MN M M O\\nCA OQ M O\\nx O 0 b o0 cn O\\nH to ro M in O\\nOn ^O ON N r- N \"O\\\\\\nh ^p m M M 110\\nor, 1- 00\\nH A^ -c N\\nn\\n•rl n\\nRN$\\nN z{ O N N t^tl F\\nW O ro .--1 0r-4 1 d\\tI m U\\nv ti cu x •r+ 0 r. l4\\ts,\\nH cD :5\\no w o n 41\\tO H\\n4 vOwl^`\\' z U)EO-i 0ro\\nOw\\nr,\\nO\\nac\\na)\\nro\\nU\\nU\\nOroO e-,\\nva -It\\n1\\n}a M\\nO\\n•nrow\\n^ v\\nC4\\n^ U\\nF\\tI ^\\n^ b\\n^xO N.,q .:\\nU)\\nm ^+\\nW\\nN C«\\nro\\n>4 bC\\nU ^+\\nco \\'r\\nFq <C\\n1\\nM\\nNr-1\\nE+\\n3-7\\nto ,a M M -It O o\\nm o L4 0 0 0\\nri O N H O O\\n^ inE Ey .-, H\\nU\\nCY) 00\\n%D\\nN ro O 4,\\' \"+ N N\\nao H A\\nO N 00 O C144\\nOH CT (T O OQ 00 O O\\n?4 i\\tE+ H H\\nO\\nCr QCs M u1 v1\\nNM M\\nM M O a,\\'E: a\\nt^ ld* .1 O O\\nO H M -7 N O O\\nC -`r O O?fE•H HO _\\nCr Ci M O M Cl)\\nz,\\'J,1+CT O ^` M Cl)\\n!V c -7 to 1\\'1 H H\\nE- Q H H\\n,a r. rn o 01-4O E+ •^` N N O OO 00 HO OO dam: H .-+ ^-+\\nCr %L} N ON I\"w r~\\nN O O\\nE-4E A\\nr.a CT O r` O\\nHO O N t70 t70 O\\nO M -7 H O\\nE+H\\nC7^ u\\'1 ^O OU4a\\t1\\tN\\nO\\t10 O O\\nco\\t5Cl).. to H Ci\\nto H O —4 N Lr) r,\\nz iYl lQ rn O Ln H 110\\nO A M ^ H ^ N H\\nH\\n,.^ rn Ln rn a\\n° H C4 M .t tp 0\\nO NN .*OH-4\\nco m M O\\nUw\\t1\\ta)\\nx O G 10 i n is O`fi O\\\\tT3.\\nCr H -zr O it1 N f3z I71 M lzr H 00 M -^Q Ln L n H H H M 0HHN\\nn\\nJ.1\\n-r4 n\\nz w a +\\noffm cu\\nP^ rd\\nE- N tz A^^ ot!41\\tro a:\\n<\\t1\\'+ 1\\tO1\\t.n4+ O ..O ^.O\\n4JO\\nO Ea\\nO^CHta O^ vto O z HGro\\nI-0\\nO44\\n:-1,\\nI•+\\nO\\nd0\\nN\\nco\\nv\\nvV r^.\\nv\\nO IO M\\nM\\nP 4-4 ,.\\nn^\\nro v\\nrn\\nN G\\n00 •r1\\nA ro\\ntoG tv\\nO a.,q 3\\nU) ^4\\n•ra w\\na\\nN U)\\ntll\\nt60\\nO N\\na 6\\ntt1\\nIM\\n(1)\\n.-i\\nCd\\nEt+rt ^ N\\nN En .H\\nN O tU\\nO\\np U •o\\nO •ri •rt\\n4a 94 al\\nu O\\nbroA A ^\\n?4\\nt\\'1 ,C 4.1\\nu 4J ri\\nO OG thro •rlG ^\"O O\\n4-^ tU\\nO \\no Gcr O4J to •rt\\nG ro ,uG 3 ^\\nr a •r,\\nro zJ O\\n.rq p\\n4J r-i a\\nq •ra\\nro rQ 5.4U ro tll\\n•ri ,-i ^\\n4-r •r1 0\\nG >b4 ro G\\nE\\tro 4J\\nG a 4.4 bC ra\\n.ro JJ ^ 34\\n:3 r-1 r-1 4- J 10\\nby ro •r^ ^ro.1 r`^\\n>a 44 tit \\t O\\na Co .ro ° Cl)\\nro T1\\tG •ri\\nG ro O\\nN CO o u\\ncn Gr4\\tr C,>a r-t w :3 \\'UH C M a\\nN 10\\t coa JS\\n+^ G ty\\nro ro ^ CA r-I\\n0 O O pro Atr ^^\\nO G O.^ IH U 0) U\\nr{ 1.1 r7 bQ1.1 ro 0\\t coG 1W •rt tU d 3\\ntV 0 iJ k ro\\n> + M C3 0 4-1\\n> r,\\tO\\nU U 0   M\\ncc 110\\nEi \\n^ c o x\\nto G 4 1-1 •r01\\n^ E-+ Es a ^\\nco u\\n3-8\\n0) a11Cso co C) 0\\n41\\nO *--e E-\\n4jtr)\\n64r- ce) OQ co\\nCd 0 <\\n04 E- =\\n0 U-1 tr)\\nV,,j\\n8M E-\\nW 00 C) C^\\nz cn CD\\n<\\n00 00 --t\\n4. <\\nC E-\\nC, 7 C C\\nO E-4\\nIf)\\nE- a\\no E- h C) C\\n0 0 1-4 0\\nclq Nt clq cq\\nz In r-, 0\\nc N\\nE-4 M on\\nON 00 rn C\\nw -\\'e,\\nc F-4 C^\\nC cn CIN C4\\nC\\n4•\\nO\\n0 cz It 4t C)\\nz 1 0 It) CD—4\\n0 ei M M 00 C14 C\\nE-2\\n4,\\no 00 tr1 N O\\nO (N T-4 tr) C)\\n0\\n0 Co\\nM C14 cyi\\nC\\n4-j\\n—4\\tca ^tr\\nz + w ;F. \\xad4\\tC)\\n0 Z -4 li\\tI co\\tZ.;\\nz0 Hr4\\t-r-(0 9\\n1\\t0\\nr^ z vi cr 0\\ntry to 0 7—\\' cr3 z Htc\\nV\\nSJ\\n0)\\nL)\\nu\\nC CY)\\ncr,\\n1.4 4- 4\\n0 (1)\\nly;\\noo -,q\\ncz\\nG CJ\\n:Bc\\n(P S.4\\n4-4 C)\\nr=\\nW\\nro C/)\\n4J a)\\nw\\nco\\np\\n0 a)\\n>\\nCl)\\n0)zui\\n tr\\nW -,4r\\ntr ul as\\ntj\\ntH ^ X\\n4J C\\nX X •r4\\nW -,q\\n4-J\\n4-1 rp\\noj\\t0\\n4-1 T-H\\nZ .,4\\nH 0\\nSw >\\nt\\tcr\\nr\\t,\\nto\\tC1.4\\nr,toI\\n- CC r^\\n0 41 0\\t ::1\\nri U, to\\n>1\\n4J\\ntkc ct\\tr^\\nCU0 r-4L\\n0\\ncz\\t>\\nZ -r-i 41\\n4-1\\n^\\nC) 1*0\\t r,\\n4-1 g (1) r3 c\\n(a\\nt\\tC rz T,\\n0\\nCd\\tCr S•4 4-J\\nr= 0 w0\\n-H x\\n44\\nCP p\\nm ci d;\\t0\\nIn Denver, an emissions inventory system for each pollutant\\nis developed for existing and projected time periods for all major\\nsource contributors. This emissions system provides emission modeling\\ninputs for the current analyses. The total tonnages and relative con-\\ntributions for the major,source categories for each pollutant are shown\\nIn Tables 3-7 through 3-10.\\nTable 3-7 showy ,that over one-half of the particulate load-\\ning is attributed to dust and sand emissions from auto bile travel on\\npaved roads. The total automotive contribution varies Trom 73 to 84\\npercent of all sources over the projected period. Construction activity\\nand point sources account for most of the remaining tonnage. For\\nDenver, note that the total particulate tonnage is expected to increase\\nso that by 1985 the emission, inventory is 60 percent larger than the\\n1974 inventory.\\nThe daily source contributions for hydrocarbons is shown\\nin Table 3-8. Again the automobileAs the most significant hydrocarbon\\nsource in Denver, contributing about 80% of the hydrocarbons. Poitit\\nsources, cleaners, gasoline service stations, and airports also contri-\\nbuted. The total tonnage from automobile sources is scheduled to\\ndecrease by abot : one-half from 1980 to 1985. This is due to the pre-\\nsunied, effectiveness of the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program\\n(FMVCP) (Ref. 3-5). Automotive sources contribute 44 to 50% of the\\ntotal, depending on the year analyzed. The total tonnage of nitrogen\\ndioxide is shown to increase with,time to 1985, due to increased auto-\\nmobile emissions. The carbon monoxide emissions for 1974 are shown\\nin Table 3-10. Future years were not projected due to technical\\ndifficulties in obtaining automotive contributions. The predominant\\ncontributor of CO emissions in 1974 is the automobile.\\n3.3.3 \\t PI?oenix Systems\\nThe emissions inventory system is compiled annually by\\nthe Maricopa County Bureau of Air Pollution Control. The methodology\\nused to calculate emissions from individual sources for ,tho 1977 com-\\nprehensi)re emissions inventory is described in Ref. 34 \\'. Point sources\\ndominate the stationary source emissions except for TS;P. Unpaved roads\\nand other miscellaneous area source contributioms , represent more ,than\\n80% of the total. particulate emissions.\\nMobile sources contribute 74%`o£ the NOx, 37% of the SOX,\\nLess than 1% of the TSP (through exhaust), 95% of the CO and 56% of\\nthe NMRC. Tables 3-11 and 3-21 provide a more detailed breakdown of\\nuncontrolled CO and NMHC emission inventories for Phoenix.\\nThe reduction in CO and NMHO emissions between 1977 and\\n1985 in Tables 3-11 and 12 is due entirely to the Federal New Car\\nEmission Control Program.

Some math models may require the\\nuse of a sett of chemical equations to describe the chemistry taking\\nplace in the atmosphere. These inputs to an air quality simulation model\\nhave been schematically represented in Fig. 1-3. In this section, these\\ninputs, together with the corresponding math model, are discussed. The\\ncharacteristics of the following types,of air quality simulaf-ion model\\nare xamined:\\n(l)\\tLinear rollback\\n(2)Empirical. Kinetic Modeling Approach (EKMA).\\n(3)Photochemical dispersion models.\\n4.1\\t METEOROLOGY\\nAccording to Slade (Ref. 4-1):\\nThe waste products of our civilization must be disposed of.\\nReceptacles for this debris are the earth\\'s land masses,\\nwater bodies, and the atmosphere. The science of meteoro-\\nlogy is important in the study of the disposition of waste\\nproducts in the atmosphere.\\nWastes that are released to the atmosphere consist of\\nparticles and gases. Atmospheric residence times for some\\nof these materials may be very short, hours or even min-\\nutes. For other materials residence times may be measured\\nin terms of years. Regardless of the residence time, the\\nmovement of gases and particles in the atmosphere will\\nbe, in large measure, governed by the motions of the\\natmosphere. Some atmospheric motions dictate the paths to\\nbe followed by airborne contamination; other motions\\ndetermine the extent to which the contaminants will be\\ndiluted. The study of the effects of atmospheric motions\\non suspended pollutants is a branch of the science of\\nmeteorology variously categorized under the headings \"air-\\npollution meteorology\" or \"atmospheric diffusion.\"\\n4-1\\n4-2Meteorological factors have a very large impact on the\\nrelationship between air pollutant emissions and resultant air: quality.\\nFor example, in the South Coast region the ozone concentrations may\\nchange from a value which meets the national ambient air quality stand-\\nard (.12 ppm hourly average) to a value several times higher from one\\nday to the neat. These dramatic changes in air quality may take place\\nwith emissions which are essentially the Same. Some meteorological\\nfactors which have a significant influence on air quality predictions\\ninclude:\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(3)\\n(4)\\n(5)\\n(6)\\nThese factors areThree--dimensional distribution of wind speed and\\ndirection.\\nThe topography of\\'the .land.\\nPollutants remaining from the previous day.\\nBackground pollutant effects.\\nCloud cover.\\nTemperature distribution.\\ndiscussed in the following text,\\n4.1.1\\t Wind and \\'Temperature Measurement,\\nWind measurements o;rten determine only the horizontal wind\\ndirection and wind speed at groubd level. In many areas the only wind\\nmeasurements may be from the local airport. Some areas such as the South\\nCoast Air Basin are characterized by many such wind stations, e.g.,\\n50 stations. In areas where special studies are being performed wind\\nmeasurements may include the vertie..le component of both wind speed\\nand direction. Such measurements were performed in EPA\\'s Reg.onal. Air\\nPollution Study (RAPS).\\nMeasurements of wind, speed and direction aloft are routine-\\nly performed at airports twice daily through the release of pilot\\nballoons. More frequent measureme\\'\\'}its can be made during spacial studies.\\nIn some cases the pilot balloons ;ire equipped with a temperature\\nsensor and a transmitter. In these cases, measurements of temperature\\nas a function of altitude are obtained. In special cases such as the\\nRegional Air Pollution Study the above temperature and wind measurements\\nmay be supplemented by additional measurements from fixed wing aircraft\\nand helicopters.\\nThe wind speed and direction are often recorded on charts.\\nHourly averages of these speeds and directions are kept as part of the\\npermanent record. Hence if the wind speed and direction were highly\\nvariable during a given hour, the record woulij only indicate the average\\ncondition. Any air quality simulation model that used this averaged,\\ndata would have already filtered out considerable varlEability which\\ncould have a highly significant impact on the error in estimating air\\npollutan- concentrations. This class of error is especially significant\\nin estimating hourly averages of pollutant concentrations.\\nIt should be pointed out that this type of error is intrin-\\nsic to all the air quality simulation models. The photochemical disper-\\nsion models may estimate wind speed and direction on a 5-minute basis\\nfrom the hourly averaged data. However, the accuracy of these wind\\nrepresentations cannot be known unless examination is made of the\\ndetailed charts rather than the hourly averages. Furthermore, it would\\nbe necessary to check the model prediction with Loth the 5-minute wind\\nvalues and the hourly averages to determine the size of the error\\nassociated with this type of averaging. These t ypes of test arc, being\\nexamined in the Regional Air Pollution Study (RAPS) analysis, We have\\nnot been able to obtain the results of such analysis in this study.\\nThere may be inherent physical limitations associated with\\nmodeling the y influence of meteorological factors at time scalds of the\\norder of 5 minutes or less. For example the Pasquill stability cate-\\ngories (Ref. 4-2) that are used for both gaussian plume modeling and\\nother forms of modeling are intended to represent average dispersion\\nover a 15-minute interval if the direction of the wind Is fairly con-\\nstant, If t\\'\\'ae wind changes directions by, for example, 90 0 within the\\n15 minutes, these representations are of doubtful use.\\n,Similar comments c- In be made about the influence of the\\nfrlquQnc.y of vertical temperature distribution measureRlents (Ref. 4-3).\\n4.1.2\\t Complex \\'Terrain\\nThe topography of the land is quite complex for both \\'tic•\\nI)+.:anver Region and the South Coast Region. In comparison, Phoenix Is\\nrelatively simple. For example, \"a description of the topography for the\\nSouth Coast Air Basin (SCAB) follows (Ref. 4-3):\\nThe Basin is a coastal plain with connecting broad valleys\\nand low hills bounded b y the Pacific Ocean to the south-\\nwest and high mountains along the perimeter (see Fig. 4-1).\\nInland, the SCAB terrain varies from rugged, high mountains\\nwith elevations up to 11,500 feet, mainly in the northern\\nand eastern parts of the area, to almost flat-lying\\ncoastal plans at or just above sea level. Between the\\nmountains and the sea is a complex array of t,1rraces3\\nhills, and foothills.\\n4---3\\njsgr\\nxe\\n^ r i.r ^ \\t Q\\t 1 • •^ .:\\nSl}, \\t •_\\t a`\\'t\\t ^ ^\"\\'d^,t ►^\\ta ^:_ ^ \\t ^\\n^, \\'+\\'t .\\'^fi.,f \\t^(\\t {^^^ \\t ice►\\n,:. r\\nlo _ tar .1\\nb. ; • • • \\t ;,^,\"\\t ^\\'\\nmay ^\\t r•\\tI\\t ^ i\\n\\t4_4 \\tORIG[NAL PAGE LS\\'\\nOF POOR (QUALITY\\nC-1 ias\\nU\\nyl\\nGl\\nw\\nv\\na\\nx0a0Er\\n7\\nOG\\nw\\n,A\\nThe SCAB area includes portions of two geomorphic pro-\\nv1,\\t;, the Transverse Ranges (Santa Monica, San Gabriel\\nand an Bernardino Mountains) and the Peninsular Ranges.\\nThe Transverse Ranges include mountains and valleys having\\n• dominant east-west trend. The Peninsular Ranges have\\n• northwest trend. Besides the two ranges, the Basin is\\nalso crossed by the lower lying Coastal Ranges (Santa Ana,\\nVerdugo, and portions of the Santa Monica Mountains).\\nBetween the Pacific Ocean and the Coastal Ranges lie the\\nCoastal Plains, and between the Coastal Ranges and the\\nTransverse and Peninsular Ranges lie the inland valleys.\\nAccording to Ref. 4-4 the overall average of inversions,\\nwith heights less than 2,500 ft above sea level, occur 22 days each\\nmonth. Since this basin extends approximately 100 miles can a side,\\nthe horizontal dimension is about 200 times the vertical dimension. Thus\\npollutant concentrations are highly nonuniform within this effectively\\nwide shallow basin (Ref. 4-5). The complex set of mountains, foothills,\\ncanyons, etc., further complicates the distribution of air pollutants.\\nIn the more complex models for air quality simulation the\\ncomplexity of topography is included as a set of inputs. For example,\\na computerized topo-mao of the South Coast Region is shown in Fig. 4-2.\\n(Ref. 4-6)\\nFig. 4-2. Grid Structure Model of the South Coast Region\\n4-5\\n4.1.3\\t Background Effects\\nBackground concentrations of pollutants are associated with\\ntwo principal categories: (1) pollutants transported into a given\\nregion and (2) pollutants that are generated by natural earth processes\\nsuch as windblown dust in the desert, or hydrocarbons emitted from\\ntrees. The second category is referred to as geogenic sources.. Hence\\na given area might have certain concentrations of pollutants even if\\nthe area were totally uninhabited.\\nThe pollutants transported into a given region can be a\\ncombination of natural background coming into the region plus pollutants\\nfrom major sources such as metropolitan areas which are outside of a\\ngiven region. The natural background pollutants may be assumed to be a\\nconstant for the purposes of worst-ca$.e analysis. The pollutants that\\nare transported into a region from another urban area may decrease as\\nthe air quality in that other metropolitan area decreases. Hence, it is\\nimportant to distinguish between transported pollutants from geogenic\\nand anthropogenic sources.\\nSome geogenic sources may be approximately constant,\\nwhereas others ma y be highly variable. An example of a bighly variable\\ngeogenic source is stratospheric intrusion. At the National Commission\\non Air Quality\\'s Photochemical Modeling Workshop, it was reported that\\n\"Ozone concentrations in the troposphere free from anthropogenic influ-\\nences are, according to some, generated primarily by ozone transfer to\\nthe troposphere from the stratosphere. The relative contributions of\\nvarious stratospheric/tropospheric ozone transfer mechanisms to the\\ntotal ozone background transported from the stratosphere are not well\\ndefined. However, transport from the stratosphere to the troposphere by\\nmeans of large-scale eddies or stratospheric air intrusion, usually\\nassociated with cyclonic activity, can cause relatively high levels\\nof oz^.\\xad•nne to be observed at ground levels for short periods of time.\"\\n\"Ozone concentrations in excess of 80 ppb often occur over\\n.Large regions where plumes from large urban centers are not apparent\\n(rural ozone blanket problem).\"\\nAt the workshop, an extreme example of stratosph^-ic intru-\\nsion was described for Santa Rosa, California, which is a rurai\\'farming\\ntown. During the afternoon, ozone concentrations of .04 ppm were\\nobserved. At approximately 4:00 a.m. the next morning, the ozone level\\nrose to .23 ppm, which is approximately twice the national primary\\nambient air quality standard for ozone. It was apparently quite clear\\nthat this ozone did not come from anthropogenic sources. Hence, Santa\\nRosa exceeded the national standard for ozone even though this was\\nbeyond the control of the City of Santa Rosa.\\n4-6\\niIt is apparent that methods are needed to allow for pheno-\\nmena such as stratospheric intrusions to be considered in such a way\\nas not to constitute a violation of the national primary air quality\\nstandard. One approach to this problem would be to determine the fre-\\nquency on an annual basis of stratospheric intrusion of ozone, and to\\nallow the standard to be exceeded by the number of days that such\\nintrusion could occur. It should be noted that this argument has nothing\\nto do with the health effects of ozone. It simply may be that even\\nthough ozone has health effects at some low concentrations, we may not\\nbe able to prevent those concentrations from occurring a few times\\na year.\\nThis type of problem is not a major consideration in some\\nplaces such as the South Coast Air Basin, where the ambient air quality\\nstandard for ozone is exceeded on over 200 days a year. However this\\ntype of phenomenon could be a. problem in a region which exceeded the\\nozone air quality standard a few times a year. In addition, if some\\nmore robust standard were used, such as \"not to exceed .12 ppm more\\nthan 30 times a year,\" then many of the instrumentation and modeling\\nproblems would be simplified. For example, the statistical basis of\\nusing the hKMA model would be greatly improved. The general influence of\\nbackground pollutant conventration on the EI0LLA model is discussed in\\nRef. 4-7.\\n4.1.4\\t Multiple Day Meteorology\\nIn some areas, such as the South Coast Air Basin and the\\nDenver region, the wind may change direction by 180 0 from day to night.\\nHence, the emissions and ,their by-products from one day may be blown\\nback to the region b^ contribute to degrading the next day\\'s air qual-\\nity. In some sense, under these circumstances a region can be \"down-\\nwind of itself.\" This component of pollutants transported into a region\\nmay strongly influence the \"boundary conditions\" for a given day. Hence,\\na \"worst case day\" may not only be influenced by the emissions of that\\nday, but also be influenced by the emissions of the previous day.\\nThis concept was thought to have considerable Importance\\nby the members of the Photochemical Modeling Panel at the National\\nCommission on Air Quality\\'s Workshop. The following comar^ents Caere made\\nin an issue paper.\\n^a\\n\\\\W\\n4-7\\nAt night, atmospheric inversion protects ozone aloft from\\ndestruction by NO scavengors while ground level ozone\\ntends to be destroyed (although high ground level ozone\\nlevels have been measured at night). The following day,\\ninversion breakup allows downward mixing of the ozone and\\nany unreacted precursors aloft with the new day\\'s local\\nprecursor emissions and any other pollutants transported\\nfrom upwind. Some investig;^tors believe that the downward\\nmixed ozone can contributol\"substantially to the new dayV8\\nurban ozone levels; others believe that only ozone gen-\\nerated in the mixed layer is important—that ozone aloft\\nwill bo scavenged by NO upon downward mixing into urban\\nareas. Such may not be the case tit rural areas where NO\\nconcentrations are low. Some also believe that the second\\nday irradiation of unreacted precursors aloft may contri-\\nbute substantially to the new day\\'s ozone levels. In\\nany event, the downwind (local) ozone levels are not\\nnecessarily primarily determined by local emission:.\\nIn separate conversations with both (3, McRae of Caltech\\nand A. Ranzierri of the California Air Resources Board, they stated\\nthat on days of oz, \\xad.-,^? episode condition ,,; Llie back ground concentrations\\nof air pollutants at the beginning of the day can. \\ta highly signi-\\nfleant influence on the air quality later in the day. From the comments\\nabove concerning downward mixing of ozone and any unreacted precursors\\naloft, :it appears that it is Important to include the influence of\\nimiltiple-day meteorology in gr. d air quality simulations for ozone.\\n4.2\\t PHOTOCHEMISTRY\\nIn order to provide some indication of the complexity of\\nthe Interac.tioris between transportation systems and the air quality of\\na region, this section discusses photochemical smog rea y.tions. This\\ndiscussion will not be complete since its intention i.8 only to outline\\nthe principles involved in photo cheiiii s try in the urban otmosphere, For\\na more detailed presentation, please see Air Pollution: Physical and\\nChemical Fundamentals by John H. Seinfeld. The brief outlines presented\\nhere attempts to show how the oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons and\\nsunlight interact to form photocheiiiLcal smog.\\nMany urban centers are characterized by a brown pall of\\ngas surrounding, the city. This brown gas is nitrogen dioxido. It\\nabsorbs sunlight for wavelengths less than 4300 A. This absorption\\nprocess can cause the rupture of one of the bonds in the NO2 molecule\\nthus changing the NO2 to NO plus an oxygen atom in the triplet 11\\nstate, 0 (31)).\\t\\nNO2 + li%,,\\tNO + 0(3p)\\t (4-1)\\nThis triplet 1) oxygen atom can collide N qitli other oxygen molecules in\\nsuch a way,.^o produce ozone as is shown In Eq.(4-2).\\n4-8\\n►,..\\nd\\n0(3p) + 0  + M - 0 3 + M \\t (4-2)\\nIn this equation, M symbolizes a third molecule which absorbs excessive\\nvibrational energy. Once the ozone is formed, it can, --.,-,ct with nitric\\noxide, if it is available in the atmosphere, to \\'once l. ,Y\\'r \\'\\' ..Lorm NO 2 and\\noxygen as outlined in Eq. (4-3)• \\t}\\n03 + NO ^+ NO 2 + 02\\t (4-3)\\nTitus, the NO2 molecule in Eq. (4-2), which is broken up by the light into\\nNO and oxygen, has the NO component converted back to NO2 through an\\ninteraction with ozone. Hence, the chemical cycle is complete. This\\ncycle is referred to as the photolysis cycle. Some further insight into\\nphotochemistry can be obtained by looking at the reaction kinetics,\\ni.e., the rates at which these compounds interact. From Eq. (4-1), it\\nmay be shown that the rate of change in the concentration of nitrogen\\ndioxide, d/dt [NO2] is proportional to the concentration of NO2 as shown\\nin Eq. (4-4) .\\ndt [NO2]\\t_ kl [NO2]\\t (4-4)\\nwhere k  depends on the intensity and wavelength of the sunlight.\\nFrom Eq. (4-3) an expression can be written foi , the rate\\nof change in the concentration of ozone. Since the ozone and the NO\\ninteract in this equation, the rate of change of ozone is proportional\\nto the product of the concentration of ozone and the concentration of\\nNO or nitric oxide as is shown. in Eq. (4-5) .\\ndt, [03]\\t= k3 [03]\\t[NO]\\t (4-5)\\nWhen Eqs. (4--1,2,3) are in ey. \\', akbrium, every molecule of NO2 that is\\nbroken up is replaced by the br: A,a \\'kup of a molecule of ozone. Hence,\\nin equilibrium the time rate of change of the concentration of NO2 is\\nequal to the time rate of change of the ozone concentration as shown in\\nthe following\\ndt [NO2] \\tcd3t [03]\\nby substitution from (4) and (5), this becomes:\\nk  [NO 2]\\tR It  [ 03]\\t[NO]\\nHence, the concentration of ozone is shown in Eq. (4-6).\\nk \\t[No 21\\n[ 3]\\t k3\\t[NO ]\\n4-9(4-6)\\nThus, if Eqs. (4-1,2,3) govern completely the production ozone, the\\nconcentration of ozone depends on the ratio of concentration of NO2 to\\nthe concentration of NO. According to Seinfeld, the cycle time\\nassociated with reactions 1 through 3 is typically short enough that\\nthis approximation for the steady-state concentration of ozone is\\nreasonable.\\nThus, to convert NO to NO 2 requires the consumption of a\\nmolecule of ozone. We will next examine chemical reactions which convert\\nNO to NO 2 without the consumption of ozone. These reactions cause the\\nratio of NO2: NO to become larger, hence the ozone concentration\\nincreases.\\nAccording to Falls et al. (Ref. 4y8), the two main pro-\\ncesses by wlracb NO is converted to NO 2, without the loss of ozone,\\ninvolve the ,\\',Jiydroperoxy radical NO 2 and peroxyal.kyl radicals R0 2 via\\nH02 + NO -, OH + NO2\\nR02 + NO -} RO + NO2\\nHydroperoxy and peroxyalkyl radicals arise in the photo-\\t\\nchemical smog system from the photolysis and oxidation of hydrocarbon \\t °a\\nspecies (Ref. 4-8). The contribution of non-methane hydrocarbon to\\nphotochemistry is essential in order to explain the observed nitric\\noxide to nitrogen dioxide conversions. In this cycle, NO is converted\\nto NO2 by interacting with hydrocarbons without reacting with ozone.\\nHence the concentration of NO 2 is increased without a corresponding\\ndecrease in the concentration of ozone. At the start of this cycle,\\nhydroxyl radicals (OH-) and hydrocarbons (HC) react according\\' to\\nEq.

The photolysis series (Eqs. 4-1 to 4-6) is\\ntypically fast enough for till steady state relationship (Eq. 4-6) to be\\nvalid. The second series (Eqs. 4-7 \\'through 4-11) provides an example\\nmechanism for conversion of NO to NO 2 without depleting 0 3. According\\nto Seinfeld, \"Afthough this description is very Simplified, these two\\ncyclic series contain the essential features of ozone formation.\\'\\'\\nThese two types of reactions are shown in Fig. 4-3.\\n4.3\\t THREE AIR QUAL11T SIMULATIONS MODELS\\nin the following section three air quality simulation\\nmodels area discussed: linear rollback, EKMA, and photochemical dis \\nbursion. These models range in order of complexity from the simplest11th\\nthe most complex in terms of bath input data requirements and sophisti-\\ncation required to.operaate the models. Decent review of ether models\\nhas been provided by Bruce Turner of the Environmental Protection Agency\\n(Ref. 4-9). This review, coupled with the discussion paper: that followed\\nit (Ref. 4 -10), provides teal insights into the y strengths and limita-\\ntions of the models described in these reports.\\n4.3.1 \\t RoIIbock\\nLineaar rollback i5 by far the simplest air quality simul.a-\\ntiena, model..

This\\nvirtue is also its vice, since its simplicity causes many people to\\nbelieve that it just simply is not adequate to handle air quality\\nmanagement. It is thought that this equation aggregates at too high a\\nlevel. Fur example, the emissions in Eq. (4-15) represent the emissions\\nfor an entire air quality basin, and the air quality is some represen-\\ntative, perhaps average number, for the entire basin. These concepts\\nignore the idea that both the air quality and the emissions pattern\\ncan be highly dependent on position within the basin. Nevertheless, we\\nshall examine the linear rollback approach as compared to the more\\nsophisticated empirical kinetic modeling approach (EKMA) to explore\\nthe practical differences between the predictions of each model.\\n4.3.2 \\t Vmpirical Kinetic Modeling Approach (%+, \\'KMA)\\nThe fundamental ideas behind the Empirical Kinetic Model-\\ning Approach are described quite well in the users\\' manual (Ref. 4-11).\\nThe apn4oach is based on the use of smog chamber data to relate ambient\\nconcentrations of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), oxides of nitrogen\\n(NOX),t and ozone. A standard set of EKMA curves is shown in Fig. 4-4.\\nDepending on the sophistication that is used in the EKMA, either these\\nstandard curves can be used, or a set of special curves can be gener-\\nated for a given location such as the South Coast Air Basin. Referring\\nto Fig. 4-4, the vertical axis is the oxides of nitrogen, NOX, in\\nparts per million. The horizontal axis represents the non-methane hydro-\\ncarbons, NMHC, again in parts per million, as carbon. A set of \\'curves\\n4-12\\nis drawn on these axes, each for a fixed value of ozone. For example,\\nthe curve which is marked ..,, ppm of ozone indicates the focus o4 points\\nof NOx and NMHC which will produce a peak ozone hourly average value of\\n.12 ppm, the National Primary Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone.\\nAs an example of the use of EKMA, suppose the concentration\\nin a given locality is .28 ppm of ozone.. Suppose in that locality it has\\nbeen determined that the ratio of non-methane hydrocarbon to the oxides\\nof nitrogen is 12 to 1. One can draw a line on the EKMA diagram with a\\nslope of l part in 12. This line intersects the .28 curie line at the\\npoint marked A on the diagram. The point A corresponds to the following\\nvalues: NMHC = 1.25 ppm and NO X = .12 ppm.\\n0.28\\nj0.24\\n0.20\\n0.16\\nEa-n\\nO^\\nZ0.14\\n0.08\\n0.04\\n0O rN- \\tN N N M CM M M\\nQ O O O O \\t O O Q Q \\t O\\n1\\nNMHC =12:1\\nNO\\na^\\t a0.40\\n0.36\\n0.34\\n0.32\\n0.30\\n0.28\\nON\\n0.24 O\\n0.20\\n0.16\\n0.12\\n0.08\\n0\\t 0.2\\t0.4\\t0.6\\t 0.8\\t 1.0\\t 1.2\\t1.4\\t 1.6\\t 1.8\\t 2.0\\nNMKC, ppmC\\nFig. 4-4. Ozone Isop.leths Derived for an EKMA Analysis\\n4-13\\nIf one decides to reduce this peak value of ozone with a\\nstrategy which is based solely on reducing non-methane hydrocarbons,\\nthen one moves from the point marked A on the EKMA diagram to the point\\nmarked A\\', Since the value of NO x remains the same, the value of non-\\nmethane hydrocarbons is reduced to about 0,35 ppm; i.e., the non-methane\\nhydrocarbons are reduced by approximately 72%. An opposite strategy\\ncould be followed to reach the ozone standard. The value of none-methane\\nhydrocarbons is reduced by approximately 72%. An opposite strategy\\ncould be followed to reach the ozone standard. The value of non.-methane\\nhydrocarboe, ls could be kept constant, and the -oxides of nitrogen could^^\\nbe reduced. In this case, we move from point \\tto point B in Fig. 4-4.\\nThe value of NO x is reduced from .12 ppm to a new value of 0.25 ppm;\\ni.e., NOx is reduced by 79%. Apparently other approaches can be used,\\nsuch as simultaneously reducing both the NO x and the NMHC. For example,\\none could move along the 12 to 1 ratio line shown in Fig. 4-4 until\\nthat line intersected the .12 ppm ozone isopleth.\\nHence the EKMA approach can be used to estimate effects\\nof the combined reduction in non-methane hydrocarbons nd oxides of\\nnitrogen. Since ozone depends on both NOx and NMHC, as discussed in\\nSection 4.2 on photochemistry, this approach appears to be intrinsi-\\ncally superior to linear rollback, which simply relies on reducing a\\nsingle pollutant to reduce the ozone. To test this concept, we have\\ncompared the predicted percentage reductions in non-methane hydrocarbon\\nusing both linear rollback and the Empirical Kinetic Modeling Approach.\\nFor example, let\\'s assume that both NMHC and NOx are simultaneously\\nreduced in such a way that their ratio NMHC/NOx,is a constant. The\\ndata for this comparison is provided in Ref. 4-12. Figure 4-5 shows\\nthe percentage reduction in NMHC determined by the EKMA approach on\\nthe vertical axis and the percentage reduction in NMHX as determined\\nby linear rollback on the horizontal axis. If the two models completely\\nagree, the data points would lie on the 45 0 line, which is marked\\n\"rollback equal EKMA.\" Data shown in Fig. D for ozone concentrations\\nof .2, .3, and .4 ppm comes surprisingly close to the 45 0 line. This\\ndata could be represented by a line parallel to the 45 0 line with an\\noffset of approximately 15%. That is, if we add 15% to the predicted\\nreductions based on linear rollback, we arrive at a prediction which\\nagrees quite closely with the EKMA reductions. Hence, in this mode,\\nEKMA requires tighter controls on emissions than linear rollback. An\\nalternate approach to reaching the ozone standard can be used to compare\\nthese models. In this approach, the NO  is held constant and the NMHC\\nis,;reduced. This is similar to that described before in Fig. 4-4, where\\nthe reduction went from point A to point B. A comparison of the reduc-\\ntions in non-methane hydrocarbon as determined by EKMA and linear\\nrollback are shown .jj Fig. 4-6. Once again the 45 o line represents the\\n\"line of equivalence\" between the two models; i.a ,., on this line the\\ntwo models predict the same percentage reductions.\\n4-14\\n100\\t\\n90\\t\\nS\\ni^\\t0\\n0 L^\\n0A•\\t\\n70\\t ® °\\n0\\n0 •60\\nz\\nz0\\tROLLBACK = EKMA\\n50\\nne\\n3t\\n4\\n40\\nW\\nNMHC = CONSTANT\\n30\\n•\\t ^1 0 3=0,2 ppm\\n• 0 3 = 0.3\\t\\n20\\t0 03 = 0.4\\n10\\n0\\t\\n0\\t 10\\t 20\\t 30\\t 40\\t 50\\t 60\\t 70\\t BO\\nROLLBACK% REDUCTfON NMHC\\nFig. 4-5.

Percentage Reduction Correlation Between EKMA\\nand Linear Rollback Analyses of NMHC Holding\\nNO, Constant\\nFigure 4-6 has more detail than Fig. 4-5 since it indicates\\nthe initial ratio NMHC/NO x, in addition to the initial. concentrations\\nof ozone. In this case for a low NMHC/NO x ratio, i.e., 4 to 8, the EKMA\\npredictions and linear rollback agree reasonably well, as may be seen\\nby examining the triangular points shown, in Fig. 4-6. However, as\\nthe NMHC/NO x ratio is increased to the range of 8 to 12, one finds\\nthat the fit is not as good. In this range it appears that the EKMA\\nreduction is approximately 20% higher than that attained on the basis\\nof linear rollback. For high NMHC/NO x ratios, i.e., 13 to 40, one finds\\nthat the EKMA predictions can be approximated by adding about 30%\\nto the linear rollback predicted reductions. Hence, for both of the\\nstrategies of ozone reduction that have been examined, there appears\\n`\\t to be a fairly simple relationship between the NMHC reductions based\\non ,Linear rollback and those based on the Environmental Kinetic Model-4\\ting Approach.\\nr;100\\n90\\n80\\n70\\nx\\nz60\\n2O\\nU0 50\\na\\n40\\nw\\n0\\n20\\n10s\\nR\\nC 4-16\\n0.40\\ng 0.30\\n02w\\n0.20+25% 00 ON\\nO\\nGo\\tM\\n10\\nHV^ -25%\\nJ\\n^E\\n0P)\\n00.50\\na0.10\\n0\\nPREDICTEDO 3ON DESIGN DAY, ppm\\nA: BAKERSFIELD \\t 8/15/77 \\t 1:\\tSAN DIEGO \\t 7/7/76\\n6: FRESNO \\t 9`3;x76 \\t J: SAN JOSEAOS GATOS \\t 9/25/78\\nC; SAN JOAQUIN \\t 7/30/77 \\t K: S.F., RICHMOND/DELTA 9/25/78\\nD: STANISLAUS \\t 96,!77 \\t L.\\tLOS ANGELES/AZUSA \\t 9/8/79\\nE: SACRAMENTO \\t 8/5/78 \\t M: LOS ANGELES/PASADENA 9/9/79\\nh SACRAMENTO \\t 6126/76 \\t N: LOS ANGELES/PASADENA 9/10/79\\nG: LOS ANGELES/PASADENA 7/13x8 \\t O: LOS ANGELES/PASADENA 9/11/79\\nH.

This data is shown in Pig,. 4-7, which is a plot of\\nmeasured ozone vs predicted ozone for certain design days for 16\\nCalifornia regions.

Protection Agency\\nattributes to the .model of less than ±70% (Ref. 4 k-12, p. 72).

Also, \"the ch mical equations which are in the standard EKMA\\npackage can be modified if other equations are more app-ropri.ate for a\\ngiven region. These modifications are described in the uses manual\\n(Ref. 4-14).\\n4-17\\n4.3.3\\tPhotochemical Dispersion Models\\nThe photochemical dispersion models are by far the most\\ncomplex of the three under discussion. Excellent summaries of the cur-\\nrent state-of-the-art in photochemical dispersion models are found in\\nthe reports by McRae et al. (Refs.\" 4-8, 4-15 and 4-16) and Rcynolds\\net al. (Reif. 4-17). Earlier work by Eschenroeder et al. (Reif. 4-18)\\nprovides a historical perspective.\\nAccording, to McRae et al. (Ref. 4-15),\\nModeling urban scale air pollution is essentially\\nthe problem of describing the formation and transport\\nof chemically reacting species in the turbulent\\nplanetary boundary layer. The present model, based on\\nthe species conservation equation and a K-theory\\nturbulence closure assumption, is given by\\nac.\\n--I + V -0C i) = V • (K •VCi) + R  (Ci,...,Cn) t) \\t(1)\\nat\\nrahere Ci is the concentration of species i, }i is the\\ncarrier fluid velocity, with components (1J, V, W), and\\nK the second-order, turbulent diffusion tensor. In\\ncurrent applications of the model chemical interactions\\nRi are described by the 50-step, lumped hydrocarbon\\nreaction mechanism of Fa.,Js and Seinfeld (Ref. 4-19).\\nFigure 4-8 is a simplified representation of various\\nelements which dither form a part of Eq. (1) or .\\nnecessary inputs to the y solution processes. The validity\\nand {accuracy of the various assumptions involved in thederivation of I:q .

A descrip-\\ntion of the procedures used to generate this wind field from the\\navailable ground data and data aloft is described in Ref. 4-21. The\\nother components of meteorological factors in Figure 4-8 are cloud\\ncover, radiation at ground level, temperature, inversion height,\\ntransport and turbulence, including the effects of surface topography.\\nThe pollutant sources in Fig. 4-8 are broken up into three categories:\\n(1) anthropogenic sources, (2) geogenic sources, and (3) pollutants\\nthat have been transported into the region. Chemical processes are\\nincluded in the model, shown in Fig. 4-8. Homogeneous processes describe\\ngas to particulate interactions. Various other processes for removal\\nof pollutants are considered such as surface removal and other sink\\nprocesses such as rainout. These components form part of the chemistry\\nblock, The information from the meteorological block, the source\\nblock, and the chemistry block enters into the mathematical block for\\ncalculation of the resultant concentrations of pollutants as a function\\nof spatial coordinates and time.\\n4-18\\nHETEROGENEOUS \\t HOMOGENEOUS \\t SURFACE .\\nPROCESSES \\t PROCESSES \\t DEPOSITION\\nCHEMISTRY [REACTIONSHOTOCHEMICAL \\t THERMOCHEMICAL \\t\\nlt^ l\\nCHEMIC\\tSINK REACTIONS \\t PROCESSES\\nAL\\nI\\t PROCE55E5\\nEMISSIONS\\nI» ANTHROPOGENIC\\n2: GEOGENIC\\nSOURCES\\nPOLLUTANTS\\nTRANSPORTED\\nINTO REGIONMATHEMATICAL \\t COMPUTEDSOURCES \\tMODEL \\t CONCENTRATIONS \\tOUTPUT\\nTRAMSPORT\\nWIND\\nINVERSION \\tTURBULENCEHEIGHT\\nMETEOROLOGY\\nTOPOGRAPHY\\nAND SURFACE\\nROUGHNESS\\nTEMPERATURE \\t RADIATION \\t CLOUDCOVER\\nFib;. 4-8. F,lements of the Photochemical Dispersion \\'Model\\n4-19\\nThis model requires that the emissions data be broken up\\ninto grid cells in accordance with the location of the emission sources.\\nTypically the grid cells may be 5 km on a side. If a given grid cell\\nhas one or more major pollutant sources, there may be treated as a\\npoint sources, with their precise Locations specified.\\nAn example of the daily emissions inventory for reactive\\nhydrocarbons for the South Coast Air Basin is shown in Fig. 4-9\\n(Ref. 4-21). The top part of this figure shows the five counties that\\nare in the South Coast Air Basin: Ventura County, Los Angeles County,\\nOrange County, San Bernardino County, and Riverside County. Below this\\ncounty map are shown the total. daily reactive hydrocarbon emissions\\nfor each grid cell. This map of emissions by grid square can be quite\\nuseful in determining errors within the emissions inventory of a given\\nregion. It is quite difficult to find the errors simply by going\\nthrough the computer printouts because of both the basically dull\\nnature of the work and the extremely large amount of data. However, a\\nthree-dimensional graphical presentation, such as that shown in Fig.\\n4-9, can cause certain errors to leap out. Hence, by putting the\\nemissions inventory in this form., errors within the emissions inventory\\nc&—i be reduced. G. McRae reporl..edthat during his early checks or the\\nemissions inventor y for the South Coast Air Basin a coordinate error\\nwas somehow made. This caused an cloctrical power plant to apparently\\nbe emitting various pollutants out In the ocean! This kind of represen-\\ntation quickly shows up an error such as that.\\nThis representation also shows the beginnings of the com-\\nplexity of the use of a photochemical dispersion model for estimating\\nthe air quality in a region. It\\'s quite expensive and complicated to\\nobtain this much data, check it, and put it into such an emissions\\ninventory. This data is not only needed on a 24 hourly average basis\\nbut is also needed on the time scale the order of an hour, in order\\nto support predictions of the maximum hourly concentration of ozone.\\nR, Blackwell of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and G. McRae of Caltech\\'s\\nEnvironmental Quality Laboratory produced a set of non-methane hydro-\\ncarbon emission isopleths for each hour on .June 26, 1976, to demon-\\nstrate the hourly variability of the emissions of reactive hydrocarbons.\\nThese isopleths are shown in Fig. 4-10. An examination of these pat-\\nterns for the hours of 2:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., 4:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m.\\nreveals very little change in the emission patterns. However at\\n6:00 a.m, the influence of daily commuting back and forth to work\\nstarts to considerably change the emission patterns. Major increases\\ntend to follow the freeways and also occur in the major cities. For\\nexample, the reactive hydrocarbon emissions in terms of kilograms per\\nhour per grid cell, in the area of Pasadena and Los Angeles, are taken\\nfrom Fig. 4-10 and displayed in Table 4-1. Pasadena is clearly identi-\\nfied in the traps in Fig. 4-10. In order to determine the location of\\nLos Angeles, for example, consider the set of isopleths at 9:00 a,m.\\n.Just to the west of Pasadena there is a very bright white spot shown\\ncorresponding to grea\\':er than 1,000 kg per hour per grid cell.

In both areas the emissions start to change dramatically at\\n6:00 a..m. By 8:00 a.m. Pasadena has peaked at an emissions between\\nc:,)! and 700, whereas Los Angeles is still. increasing in the range of\\nbi l to 999. The emissions drop somewhat in both areas between the hours\\nof 10:00 a.m. and about 3:30 p.m. For example, Pasadena has values\\nranging between 451 and 600 from 9:00 a,m. till 5:00 p.m. At 5:00 in\\nthe afternoon the Pasadena value increases to reflect the increase in\\ntraffic. A similar phenomenon occurs in Los Angeles at 4:00 p.m. and\\ncontinues until 7:00 p.m. By midnight in both areas the emissions have\\n\\':approached the 2:00 p.m. emissions of the same day. 4imilar tables could\\nbe constructed for all the major cities in the South Coast Air Basin,\\n[fence, one can see that the representation in Fig, 4-10 contains an\\nenormous amount of data coded in such a way as to be highly visible\\nto allow the modeler or the air quality pTanner to see quite easily\\nwhat changes are taking place on an hourly basis.\\n4-211\\nFig. 4- 10.

A discussion of errors in photochemi-\\ncal dispersion modeling was provided by John Seinfeld in Ref. 4-22.\\nThe essence of the discussion follows:\\nIf we.summarize uncertainties...we have:\\n1.Chemical kinetics (ozone levels) \\t+50%\\nInitial concentrations (HNO2,\\naldehydes)\\nRate constants\\nMechanisms of hydrocarbon oxidation\\n2.Meteorology\\nWind speeds and direction \\t +20\\nMixing depth \\t +25\\nLight intensity \\t +20\\n3.Initial and boundary conditions\\nInitial concentrations aloft \\t +50\\nBoundary concentrations aloft\\n4.Emissions inventories\\n`1 NOx\\t +20\\nHydrocarbons \\t +30\\nIn the absence of detailed accuracy evaluation studies, an\\nestimate of the uncertainty in predicted ozone levels as a\\nresult of the above input uncertainties acting individually or\\nin concert represents sheer guesswork... We have singled out two,\\nof the most influential unrertainties, namely initial concentra-\\ntion of radical-producing species and the upper level boundary\\nconditions, together with the question of the degree of vertical\\nresolution for more detailed study. On the basis of [this] ...\\nand the prior validation studies cited in the previous section,\\none is inclined to place an overall uncertainty on oxidant level\\npredictions from current AGSM [air quality simulation models]\\nof +50 percent. We therefore conclude that: Oxidant level pre-\\ndictions of current grid-based AQSM (i.e., the SAI and LIRAQ\\nmodels) have an estimated uncertainty of 50 percent.\\n4.3.4\\tAir Quality Model `Calibration and Validation\\nVarious approaches can be used to calibrate and validate\\nair quality models. Simple models such as the linear drawback model\\ncan be calibrated by the technique described in Section 4.4.1. That is,\\nsimply take a .given year where the air quality is known and the emis-\\nsions are known. This then calibrates the model for the years. A more\\nsophisticated approach can be used for linear rollback and calibration\\nif many years of air quality data are available: For a given calibra-\\ntion year a plot of the rollback predicted values for other years vs\\nthe measured values can be made. This plot can be fitted by means of\\na linear regression straight line, giving a correlation coefficient\\nand a zero offset. This process can be continued for several years,\\neach time choosing a different year as the basis of calibration. One\\ncan then simply pick the year as the optimal calibration year which\\nproduces the highest correlation coefficient and smallest zero offset.\\nThis procedure would then produce the best values of background B and\\n4-25\\tPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\\na shown in Section 4.4.1.

In one approach the model can be considered to be\\nself-calibrated; that is, the information that is put into the chemical\\nmodels and the meteorological\\'modhls and the emissions models is con-\\nsidered to be the best information available and these values are sim-\\nply not adjusted. Hence, the model tends to act as if it were producing\\nabsolute values. This is the approach used,in the Caltech photochemical\\ndispersion model activity. In contrast, dn,approaca can be used in\\nwhich certain parameters Ore adjusted to calibrate the model to the\\nregion. For example, in t\\'he application of the APRAC II Carbon Monox-\\nide Model to the Phoenix Air Quality Region, it was necessary to both\\nchoose an inversion height of apnrox, ately 15 meters and multiply\\nthe predicted CO concentrations by a actor of 2.6 (Ref. 4-23) it\\norder to get a good agreement between\\'ilthe time-dependent conLentra-\\ntions at the stations and those predicted by the model, The following\\n:indicates the reasoning accompanying such calif-rations:\\nThe standard error of the adjusted estimate is a .9 ppm which\\nrepresents an eight percent standard error. The linear relation-\\nship between raw and adjusted APRAC estimates aad observed con-\\ncentrations is illustrated in Fig. IV-6 (see Ref. 4-23).\\nAlthough there were only five sites monitoring CO on January\\n16-17, 1975, the correlation between the observed and adjusted\\nestimates (Fig. IV-6, Ref. 4-23) is significant. This fit indi-\\ncates that APRAC-Il is able to simulate the spatial variation\\nin eight -hour  CO concentrations under typically severe conditions\\nwithin reasonable bounds of accuracy.\\nOne explanation foi l the large correction factor and low mixing\\nheight required to achieve accurate absolute estimates with\\nAPRAC-111 is the high \"background\" level of CO actually present\\nat the start of the inodeling per.ic d, i.e., 8 p.m. This \"back-\\nground\" level is caused by the p a._peak traffic emissions\\ntrapped at sunset by ground-based \".ersion conditions. The\\ncorrection factor and 15-tteter mixing height are methods of\\nartificially creating thos°e emissions trapped between 4-and\\n8 p.m. An alternative method would be to apply APRAC for a 12-\\nhour period begi_\\'Ining at 1600 on January 16, 1975. The latter 1s\\na preferable approach theoretically but increases APRAC com-\\nputer costs by 50 percent. For this reason and prevailing time\\nconstraints, the factoring approach was adopted as the calibra-\\ntion method for the AQMP reanalysis. However, given increased\\nresources and the use of APRAC-IT in future regional CO analyses\\nfor Phoenix, the 12-hour` averaging approach should be investi-\\ngated as an alternative,\\'and perhaps more accurate, simulation\\ntechnique.\\nThe above is an example of using a calibration technique.\\nIf there are many parameters that can be adjusted on cal-\\nibrating the model, then the r. •odel becomes of questionable value simply\\nbecause its results can,be interpreted as a form of N•-dimensional\\nspace curve fitting. Hence, the more absolute approach that is used\\nin the Caltech modeling would be intrinsically preferred.\\nHowever, in the use of any model there may be some subjec-\\ntive manipulation of the data which,\\'is not done in an Intentional man-\\nner. For example, the emissions inventory data has errors in it. These\\nerrors may be adjusted in such as way as to cause the model to give\\na bettor fit. If the model gives a bad fit on a given day, this may\\nbe indicative to the modeler that there is some problem within the\\nemissions inventory. He may then attempt to correct this problem, run\\nthe model again, and find out if the model gets better agreement or\\nnot. If the agreement is better, then it is assumed that the initial\\nproblem was due to the fact that the emissions inventory had a :pertain\\ncategory of error. Other errors in the emissions inventory may actually\\nhelp the model. Hence it is difficult to determine the preciseness\\nof the model when this approach is used. It is suggested that another\\napproach be used to determine the intrinsic value and variability\\nassociated with any given air quality simulation model.\\nIf, for example, modelers were allowed to adjust their\\nmodels with whatever calibration techniques they saw fit, for perhaps\\none or two days, then the coefficients within the model. would all be\\nfixed and no longer changed. If the emissions inventory for perhaps\\n30 days could be then put into the model by other modelers who did not\\nhave.a direct interest in the outcome of the test, one could then make\\na comparison of the actual output of the model without the model being\\nchanged in any way for 30 different days of emissions inventory data.\\nIn this way one could obtain a good indication of both the accuracy\\nand the precision of the given air quality simulation model and also\\navoid some of the potential biases that occur in h 1aving a given modeler\\ndecide on the accuracy and validity of his own model.\\nThis approach would be extremely expensive and time con-\\nsuming. It has been estimated for areas such as the South Coast Air\\nBasin that to prepare an emission inventory for a single day would\\ncost in excess of $30,000, If 30 consecutive days of emissions inven-\\ntory were prepared it would be expected that there would be some\\ndeficiencies of scale obtained and that the cost would not be simply\\n30 tunes $30,000. Perhaps the overall cost might be reduced to the\\norder of 30 times $15,000 or $450,000. This coast would only be the-\\nfirst cost in a series of costs. Once the emissions inventories were\\nprepared on a daily basis and the other faeLors were known, (such as\\nthe meteorological and possible chemical factors that might enter into\\nthe model), the model would have to be run. If it coast on the order of\\n$1000 fora given day, this type of model ruri would then cost an\\nadditional $30,000. These numbers may be on the optimistic: side. Tn\\naddition, it might cost an additional $30,000 to calibrate the models.\\nThen an evaluation of the results of the model as compared to the\\nobserved air quality data would have to be made. Thwa evaluation might\\ncost: an additional $200,000. Hence, the overall effort for calibration\\nand validation of a model for an area such as the South Coast Air Basin\\nin this manner would cost on the order of three quarters of a million\\ndollars. This price tag may seem awfully high, although it should be\\nnoted that similar efforts at producing a data base for model evalua-\\ntion conducted by the Env,^ronmental Protection Agency in the regional\\nair, pollution study at St. Louis cost approximately $25,000,000.\\nSo perhaps three quarters of a million dollars is not too high a price\\nto pay for evaluating an air quality simulation model in an area such\\nas the South Coast Air Basin.\\nOther approaches to understanding the limits of the air\\nquality simulation models can be used. An extensive set of information\\n(Ref. 4-24) is available on the sensitivity of the Caltech photochemi-\\ncal dispersion model for changes in various chemical parameters. A\\nMonte Carlo approach similar to that shown in Pig. 4-11 could be used\\nin determining the overall sensitivity of a complex model to variations\\nin the input parameters to the model. Each input parameter for meteoro-\\nlogical factors, source emission factors, or chemistry has a best\\nvalue estimate. Associated with each best value is an estimate of ,,-the\\nprecision of that value, that is, the error involved in the ?pest\\nestimate. If the assumption were made that the errors were distributed\\nin a gaussian manner, then each parameter could be characterized by\\na best estimate and a standard deviation. In this case, the highest\\nprobability for a given parameter is the best estimate\\'. Other possible\\nvalues of the parameter have lower probabilities as expressed by a\\ngaussian bell-shaped curve. Other than gaussian probability distribu-\\ntion functions may be appropriate for certain parameters.\\nIn the Monte Carlo process, the computer could randomly\\nselect a value from the gaussiau curve for each, parameter. In the\\nmeteorological area, for example, one value each could be picked for\\ninversion height, turbulence, wind and cl.oud.cover. Similar random\\nchoices would be made by the computer in the areas of emission inven-\\ntory and chemistry. Thus, for a given run, the computer would randomly\\npick from the gaussian curves a set of values for all parameters, and\\nthen calculate the predicted concentrations of the air „pollutants of\\ninterest. A second run would then be performed in which the computer\\nwould repeat the picking process, selecting a different set of para-\\nmeter values from the distribution curves. Once again, a computed se t\\nof air pollutant concentrations would be generated. This process\\nwould be repeated 40 to 60 times in order to get information on which\\noutput concentrations occur more frequently than others. Hence, for a\\ngiven location, one could make a plot of computed concentration versus\\nthe number of times it had occurred, such as that shown \\'in Fig, 4-11.\\nUsing techniques such as this, one can arrive at an unbiased estimate\\nof the effect of all the.uncertainties within air quality simul ation\\nmodels. This also provides an unbiased estimate of both precision and\\naccuracy of air quality simulation modals.\\nz0\\norUS z\\nWau\\nOn\\nv\\n.0\\na^\\nU\\n41\\ttr\\nW4-7\\nw\\nw-J\\ta\\nw\\n},\\nt O m\\nA\\n©w a\\nro u\\no +J\\nV*^VvAcn\\nONas\\na_\\nN \\'\\nz}\\nN\\nOG^^Z0X\\nLLI—+\\n•..\\nU (J.a. 1\\'\\nU(, ^..^ NZ\\t...\\nL\\nZ QN\\nzN X\\t ...O\\t\\n•^.sONd\\nMLUhF,z\\n0zSUS\\n0~^?X CL\\nwz\\nZ\"L 00 —.0 .0\\n\\\\\\t y^^^^ 4,o.i \\\\ ^ ^y.^^1 \\\\^\\nM\\n0 NzO\\nz In..„y< pazoW0N F--. =) Z\\nZ 0Fw-\\nw U\\n4-30\\nj\\n,t\\nff\\nThe cost of pdrforming such estimates would be far less\\nthan the cost of the test described earlier. It would require a good\\nset of emissions inventories for perhaps 2 or 3 days. These emissions\\ninventories may already be available. The estimates of precision would\\nrequire some rationale for determining the appropriate error in each\\nparameter going into the model, This undoubtedly would be the most\\nexpensive part of the precision check for an air quality simulation\\nmodel. In,many cases the error in the data will simply not be known.\\nIt may be that some sort of a delphi technique might be used to deter-\\nmine the estimates of the errors in each parameter going into the\\nmodel. This approach could be used with a separate set of errors for\\neach parameter. Let\\'s make a rough estimate that determining the errors\\nfor each parameter might cost on the order of $200,000. Some modifica-\\ntion wbul.d have to be made to the standard air quality simulation model.\\nto add the Monte Carlo function to it. It is assumed that this modifi-\\ncation would be fairly inexpensive: perhaps $20,000. Then the model\\nwould have to be run 40 times, Assuming that each run of the model\\ncosts $1000, this might amount to an additional $40,000. After these\\nruns were made, an analysis of the data would have to be prepared.\\nThis analysis might cost $30,000. Hence, in order to determine the\\nprecision and accuracy of a given air quality simulation model for a\\ngiven set of emissions inventory data, meteorological data ; and chem-\\nistry, the cost would be approximately $300,000.\\nApproaches other than the Monte Carlo approach described\\nabove might be used to estimate the precision of this technique, The\\nMonte Carlo approach is mentioned because it has been used extensively\\nto analyze complex systems such as computer systems, electronic cir-\\ncuits and transport and dispersion in nuclear systems. Hence, it is a\\nconservative approach to determining the precision of an.,air a-lalit,y\\nsimulation model. The authors are not aware of this process having\\nbeen done on any air quality simulation models where the effects of\\nuncertainties in emission ^nvcntories, meteorology, atmospheric chem-\\nistry and measurements have been treated simultaneously.\\n4.3.5\\tAir (duality Model. Issues\\n4.3.5.1\\tModel Complexity\\nOne of the principal issues facing an air quality manager\\nis the degree of sophistication that should be applied to air quality\\nmodeling, In this report we have seen three air quality models that\\nvary quite widely in sophistication, ranging from the simplest, being\\nthe linear rollba;k model, to the most complex photochemical disper-\\nsion class of models. The choice of a particular model would depend\\non many factors. Some of those factors will be considered in this\\nsection. In an article entitled  \"Sensitivity and Sensibility in Air\\nQuality Models\" (lief, 4-25),;MJl tlatmaker makes many interesting\\npoints.\\nThe sophistication of atmospheric pollutant emissions and diffus-\\nion mod41 (and data requirements) is advancing rapidly. On\\nthe other hand, the quality of the basic input data and the prac-\\ntice of traffic simulation modeling are not receiving the same\\nlevel of attention. The air quality models operate using the out-\\nput of the traffic simulation process demanding data for which\\nthe accuracy is difficult to confirm. The dangers of proceeding\\nby chains with sub-models which have specification error using\\ndata which are subject to measurement error are apparent. Tt\\nwould be desirable to use sophisticated air quality models to\\nanalyze the effectiveness of a set of Transportation Control\\nMeasures (TCM) in reducing pollutant concentrations. However\\nbefore these costly simulations are undertaken- less sophisti-\\ncated,\\'aggregate approaches should be usedto examine the nature\\nof the problem. These analyses may provide enough information\\nto justify the traffic, emissions, and diffusion simulation pro-\\ncess. In`somq, ,\"cases, this information may indicate that it\\nwould be a futi:Le effort to attempt to use the full,,,scale simula-\\ntion process to model the TCM strategy. In U zzase cases a less\\ndemanding method may be ,appropriate and give useful results.\\nThis same type of message has been made previously by\\nW. Alonso in Ref. 4-26. Alonso sets forth the fundamentals\\'\\nas follows:\\nLong chains of argument are the delight of theorists in the\\nsource of their mistrust by practical raen. There is some merit\\nin this distrust. Imagine that we argue that if A then B, if\\nB then C, etc. If we are 80% certain of each step in the chair:,\\nfrom the joint probability of the steps it follows that we are\\nless than 50% certain of where we stand after four steps... In\\nthis paper I will raise the issue of the effects of errors and\\ntheir propagation in models for prediction, and suggest some\\nstrategies for the selection and construction of models which\\nare intended for applied work. The gist of my argument is that\\nthe use of sophisticated models is not always best in applied\\nwork, and that the design of the model must take into account\\nthe accuracy of the data on which it will be run. There exists\\nthe possibility, which should be explored, that some of our\\nmost intellectually satisfying models should be pursued as\\nfundamental scientific research, l:at that simpler and more\\nrobust models should be used in practice.\\nAlonso makes the point that it is quite important to dis-\\ntinguish between two types of error: error of specification and error\\nof measurement. Errors of measurement are described in some detail in\\nSection 5 of this report, in particular, measurement errors involving\\nthe oxides of nitrogen, nitrogen dioxide and nitric-oxide, non-methane\\nhydrocarbon measurements, ozone measurements, and the implications these\\nhave to the ratio of non-methane hydrocarbon to NO.. Since errors of\\nmeasurement are treated in some detail in Section 5, they will not\\nbe discussed further in this section.\\n1\\ns\\n4-325\\nHence, we will confine ? our attention to errors of specifi-\\nention. In considering the throe t9pes of air quality simulation models\\nthat we have discussed thus far, linear rollback certainly has the most\\nerrors of specification. Its application is of questionable validity in\\nterms of the physical basis for the theory. The environmental kinetic\\nmodeling approach (EKMA) is an improvement in this regard in that It\\nrecognizes the behavior of botb ,non-methane hydrocarbons and NOX in the\\nair in terms of their contributions to the formation of ozone. However,\\nit also leaves much to be desired in that it artifically lumps the NOX\\nmeasurements and the non-methane hydrocarbon measurements into some\\naverage between 6:00 and 9:00 a.m. in order to predict ozone peaks\\nlater in the day. In addition, the EKNA approach considers only certain\\ntrajectories within an air basin and does not consider the entire air\\nbasin. Hence, we can eliminate all of the above objections by going to\\nthe photochemical dispersion model. Of the three considered, this model\\nhas very small errors of specification. Hence the errors of specifica-\\ntion decrease as the level of sophistication in the model increases,\\nand correspondingly, the number of parameters that go into the model\\nivireases,\\nThis approach is not without its drawbacks, however, since\\nthe number of parameters in the photochemical dispersion diffusion umdel\\nis quite large, and the measurement data base upon which analyses are\\nmade becomes sparser and sparser. For example, in the 29-species set of\\nreactions that are used in the Caltech photochemical dispersion model,\\nonly three of the species are pollutants that are regulated by the\\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. Hence, extensive measurements are only\\navailable for those three pollutants. Rather more meager data bases\\nare available for the other 26 pollutants that are in the model. Hence,\\nthe errors associated with using the other 26 pollutants individually\\ncan be significantly higher than the errors associated with using the\\nregulated pollutants. This is an example of a st uation in which the\\nspecification error becomes very ;mall by very ciosely specifying the\\nchemistry of the situation. However, the measurements error can becom..^\\nconsiderably larger because there are measurements of the species used\\nin the chemical reactions.\\nAnother example of this kind of improvement in specifica-\\ntion but worsening in terms of measurement errors involves the meteoro-\\nlogical data. For example, referring back to Fig. 4-8 in this section,\\ncloud cover may not be well known throughout the entire basin, so some\\nestimate of cloud cover may be made from one station, or estimates may\\nbe made by using a photometer. The temperature at the surface of the\\nbasin may be well known by the air monitoring stations and data from\\nairports. However, the temperature as a function of altitude is, in\\ngeneral, rather poorly known except for two times during the day. Our\\nknowledge of the behavior of temperature vs altitude in between: those\\ntimes is quite meager. Hence, once again by specifying the system in\\ngreater detail, we may increase the errors in measurement.\\n4- 33\\nSimilar comments could be made in terms of the wind field.\\nWe have a rather good set of information concerning the win; distribu-\\ntion on the surface, again from the air quality monitoring stations and\\nthe stations which measure horizontal wind speed and direction at the\\nairports. However, our knowledge of wind aloft is quite meager except\\nfor the measurements which are made at the airports twice a day, Thus,\\nphenomena such as wind sheer, where the wind direction will suddenly\\nchange between two layers of air, are not included in the model ^\\nInteresting phenomena can be seen caused by wind sheer in ohserving\\nthe plumes from two neary smoke stacks, One smoke stack might be suet)\\nthat its plume gets carried to the right, whereas the second plume\\nmight have a higher plume rise and get into a layer where the wind is\\nsheered and this plume might be sheered to move to the left. Hence,\\nthe smoke coming from two plumes could, in certain situations, be\\ngoing in directions 180 degrees apart. Again by specifying the wind\\nfield and with very limited measurements of wind aloft, we run QtG the\\ndanger of increaoing the error of measurement by decroasing the error\\nin specification. Similar comments can be made for the emission inven-\\ntories. Estimates of hourly emission rates are made from some data which\\nis, at best, credible on a yearly basis. Other emission factors are\\nused which are highly variable in themselves.\\nA general theoretical approach to summarize this type of\\nsituation has been put together by Alonso (Ref. 4-26, p. 184). Fig. 4-12\\nis a graph of totai system error on the vertical axis vs system\\ncomplexity on the horizontal axis. As was mentioned earlier, the error\\nin specification E. decreasen significantly as the complexity of the\\nsystem increases, However, for a given set of measurements, the error\\nof measurements increases significantly as the complexity of the system\\nincreases. Thus, specification and error in measurements tend to go in\\nopposite directions as the system complexity increases. That is, the\\nerror in specification decreases and the error in measurements increases,\\nsimply because we have limited measurements of some of the new materials\\nthat are specified, In Fig, 4-12, all the errors of specifications have\\nhypothetically been incorporated into the curve marked E.; all the errors\\nof measurement are included in the curve marked E m. Hence, the total\\nerror in the system is simply obtained by adding the errors of specifi-\\ncation to the errors of measuremenL for a given level of complexity, His\\ntop curve, which is marked E, is the total error in the system as a func-\\ntion of system complexity. It should be noted that this curve of total\\nerror has a minimum which is reached for levels of complexity that are\\nsmall compared to those to the far right of his complexity scale.\\n4-34\\nCOMPLEXITY\\nFig. 4—J& System Error as a Function of Complexity\\nAlonso extends this concept to two sets of me4surements,\\nlm* and E TrI , shown In Fig. 4-13. In the first set, 13J, the errors of\\nmeasurement are larger than those of a second set, E m. This difference\\ncould be due to improvements in factors such as instrumentation, quality\\ncontrol, training, etc, Since the measurement errors E. are less than\\nthose of Em*, this has the effect of driving the minimum error as a\\nfunction of complexity farther to the right side of the graph, i.e.,\\nfrom point A to point B. An the measurement error decreases, the overall-\\nminimum system error tends to lie toward more complexity. Hence, by\\nincreasing the complexity of the system we can decrease the total error\\nin the system, if the measurements accuracy justifies this change. On\\nthe other hand, if the system complexity is greater than the optimum\\nvalue for a given set of measurement error, then inceeased complexity\\nsimply increases the total system error.\\nThe authors are not aware of any analysis of this type that\\nhas been done for a complete air quality simulation model involving\\nmeteorological factors, emission inventory factors, and chemistry\\nreactions in addition to the intrinsic uncertainties that may be in\\nthe mathematicil model. It appears highly desirable that this typo of\\nanalysis be performed in order to allow estimates to be made of the\\nappropriate level of complexity in terms of minimizing the error In\\nthe overall system analysis. It should be noted that in practical air\\nquality management this type of discussion only incorporates one rather\\nlimited set of variables. Concepts such as the amount of money available\\n4-35\\nl\\t MEASUREMENT ERROR\\nTOTAL ERROR t,_ \\tJK\\nr\\nCe \\t EC)\\t ` A \\tE\\nW^- s — ^-\\t M\\n/ g\\nSPECIFICATION ERROR, ES\\nCOMPLEXITY\\nVig. 4-13.

These kinds of considerations\\nmay tend to drive the overall analysis toward even less complexity than\\nthat which would be indicated on the basis of the analysis suggested\\nabove.\\n4.3.5.2\\tSpatial Dependence\\nThe spatial resolution of an air quality simulation model\\nwill depend on many of the factors w:;-thin the model. One factor which\\ngives an obvious dependence is that of wind speed. For example, if the\\nwind speed in an area for a given hour is 5 miles per hour, then a par-\\ncel of air will move 5 miles in one hour during that hour. The actual\\nmovement of the parcel of air will of course depend on the detailed\\ndirection of the wind speed and its speed as a function of time within\\nthat hour. For example, if during half of the hour the wind is blowing\\nin the northeast direction and for half of the hour it blows in the\\nsoutheast direction, the simple averaging concept would assume that\\nthe wind during this entire hour had blown in the east direction. If\\nthe plume under consideration interacts chemically with other chemicals\\nChat may be coming from point sources, these concentrations could be\\ninfluenced dramatically, depending on whether the plume was blowing\\nin the northeast direction or in the southeast direction. Hence we have\\nan intrinsic er g-\\'or in terms of the chemical interactions that take place.\\n4-36\\nAccording to Slade (Ref. 4-27), \"In the first thousand or\\nso meters abave the earth\\'s uut\\'Cace, the wind speed and direction are\\ndetermined primarily by three forces: the force due to the horizontal\\npressure gradient, the Coriolis itorce due to th;e earth\\'s rotation, and\\nthe frictional force due to the ne, ness of the earth\\'s surface..\"\\nIn, making estimates of the behavior of the wind during\\ninterpolations from the hourly average data, the inclusion of parameters\\nsuch as the horizontal pressure gradients may tend to increase the val-\\nidity of the interpolations. However, it should be noted that an exten-\\nsive amount of averaging has already been applied to the data and\\nthere is no way to reconstruct what the wind directions actually were,\\nother than going back to the original wind data which is taken on per-\\nhaps a second by second basis with time average ranging from 1 to 10\\nseconds. Thus, going back to the example cited earlier, if the wind\\ndirection changes by 90 degrees over a period of one hour, one finds\\nthat the net wind direction for the hour is approximately that given\\nby two vectors, one going northeast, the other going southeast;\\nthat is, a single vector going in the easterly direction.. Since it is\\nmeasured on a separate sensor, the effective wind speed would indicate\\n10 miles per hour rather than 7 miles per hour, which would be the\\neffective wind speed going in the easterly direction. Hence, the degree\\nof fluctuation of the wind places intrinsic limits on the spatial depen-\\ndence that can be accurately represented in an air quality simulation\\nmodel.\\t\\n4.3.5.3\\tTemporal Dependence\\nSimilar comments can be made about the temporal dependence\\nzn\\'!addition to the uncertainties involved in the averaging processes\\ndue to averaging wind speed. Other uncertainties are involved in the\\nkinetics of the chemical reactions that take place. These in turn effect\\nthe real temporal resolution of the model. The models that are used\\nshould be able to have a temporal resolution consistent with the\\nprimary ambient air quality standards being modeled. In the case ofi.,\\nNO2, the standard requires an averaging of one ,year. In the case of\\nozone, the temporal dependence must btu reasonably accurate on the basis\\nof a single hour. Since NO and NO 2 and precursors of 03, it is necessary\\nto model them on an hourly basis, if 6 region has an 0 3 air quality\\nproblem.\\t\\n4.3.5.4\\tMultiple Day Interactions\\nAs was pointed out in Section 4.1 ..4, multiple day meteor-\\nological effects are quite important in some air quality simulation\\nmodels, especially those which involve predictions of hourly average\\nconcentrations. It should be noted that at the Photochemical Modeling\\nWorkshop of the National Commission oil Air Quality one of the issues\\npresented was the basic lack of data concerning the rates of chemical\\nreactions at night. Hence in doing a multiple day simulation it would\\n4-37\\nbe very important to adequately validate whatever information is avail-\\nable on the combined effects of chemistry and meteorology during the\\nnighttime hours. Information is needed on both homogeneous interactions\\nand het erogeneous interactions. If this data base remains unvalidated\\nit will he difficult to credibly extend the simulations meaningfully\\nbeyord a single day. It has been pointed out previously that the boun-\\ndary conditions, that is, the initial conditions of concentration of\\na variety of pollutants,, can ,be very significant in determinin,^,air\\nquality simulation predictions for a given day. It appears that much\\nmore work is needed to enable one to be able to accurately describe\\nwhat is occurring in pollutants that are aloft during the night. This\\nimportance extends not only to a,city such as Los Angeles in which\\nthe wind may slosh back and forth such that In effect it is \"downwind\\nof itself,\" but this could also have impact on cities which are downwind\\nof other cities.\\n4.3.5.5\\tBackground\\nInfluence of background has been discussed previously In\\nSection 4.1.5. Once again this influence is as \\tissue in present\\na I r quality models. Not only is background from such exotic sourcea\\nas the stratospheric intrusion or ozone important, but also background\\nfrom othor mote normal sQ,irces such -.as hydrocarbons that are emitted\\nboth from the ground and Hie trees could be Important.\\n4.3.5.6 \\t Natural Sources\\nAt the Workshop of the National Commission on_ Air Quality\\nthere appeared ti) be considernbN. , variation in the emission factors\\nassociated with hydrocarbon emissions from vegetation. It wns stated\\nthat these emission factors could easily be off by 4 orders of magni-\\ntude. It hppeiars that there is a need to pin these emission factors\\ndown much more certainly so that one can decide the true Significance\\nal\\' natural sources as compared to anthropogenic sources. This type of\\ndecision could have a very large impact on air quality management. At\\npresent the data is apparently unclear, which causes a polarization\\nIn air quality management. Some feel that natural sources contribute\\nvery strongly to the degradation of air quality in a gl\\'ven region,\\nwhereas others feel_that fltatUrdl Sources make only a swun -LI contribution.\\nIt appears vital to remove or at least tiinimize this uncertainty so as\\nto reduce the polarization that lass occurred in the political process.\\n4.\\'3.5.7\\tLimitations Due to Type of Applif,ntion\\n11ti the use or air quality simulation models there is need\\nfor sufficient time, money and skills. If these parameters are not\\navailable in adequate amounts then large compromises may be in order.\\nThe 1.977 amendments to the Clean Air Act do not appear to have allotted\\nsufficient time, dollars or skill. for the first attainment plans. It\\nIs hoped that the process is viewed as an organic process in which\\nSkills develop c yan\\tyear-by-year basis and hence quality of the plans,\\n4-38\\nboth the local plans and the states plans, should increase from year to\\nyear. The requirements for a reasonable further progress re port should\\ntend tA.drive the system in this direction. Those regions which are\\nnonpayment regions for one or more primary pollutants in principle\\nwill have better plans submitted for the 1982 SIP than for the SIP\\nrequired in 1979. However,, it should be noted that there may be still\\nfundamental uncertainties that have not been resolved in the planning\\nprocess. These uncertainties may need to be defined by the Congress\\nin the proposed 1981 amendments to the Cleat± Air Act in order to insure\\nthat they are incorporated properly by local regions, in order to\\ninsure this incorporation it would be essential for the Congress to\\nprovide adequate funding to staff the problem at the appropriate level\\nand specify more clearly milestones which would be obeyed not only by,\\nthe air quality mnnagemenr; :ciistrictsa but also by the Environm ntral\\nPaotection Agency in spec4,ying rules and regulations for .local areas.\\nTimely milestones should also-be specified for the states such that the\\nprocess is clearly understood at the threes levels: local, state, and\\nfederal.. The current process incorporates continuous changes at these\\nthree levels which serve to frustrate and in some cases cause deter-\\nloration in the quality of the analysis that is being performed.\\n4.:3.5.8 \\t Chemical Reactivity Scale for \\'Ncon iMethtane Hydrocarbons;\\nAt present the EKMA type modeling that the Environmental\\nProtection Agency calls for uses the concept of non-methane hydr vor-•\\nbans,. The concept is based can the idea that a glass or hydrocarbons\\nreacts so slowly that essentially it dues not take part in the pbotwOem-\\nicaat process. Hence, this class of hydrocarbons, that Is \"non-renctive\\nhydrocarbons,\" Is eliminated from the modeling activities. it sshould\\nbe noted that the reactivity of the reactive hydroc.aarhons ran vary\\nover \"severaal orders or magnitude for a variety of reactive hydrocarbons,\\'\\'\\nthat are found in urban atmospheres.\\nHence, it may he ver y important to develop emission Inven-\\ntories on the basis of classes of reactivity. Furthermore, If air\\nquality management continues olo.ng the ,line of simply measuring total\\nreactive hydrocarbons, as decrease in the dail y omissions of one kind\\nof relytive hydrocarbon may be attained by :shifting to a more reactive\\nhydrocarbon. If the quantity of hydrocarbons Is decreased by, for\\nekaampl.e, a factor of 2, this might loot: like improvement. However, it\\nthe reactivity Is increased by a factor of 10, which could easily\\nhappen, then the net effect would be to worsen the effective emissions\\nfrom thAt :source by as factor of 5. This issue appears to be one of\\ngreat importance and should be resolved A ordef to prevent control tsar-\\ntics which are counterproductive In termw of their influence on photo-\\nchemical smog,\\ni\\n4-39\\n4.3.5.9 \\t Modeling Ut icertainty\\nIn this inaction we summarize the uncertainty associated\\nwith the air quality models. Earlier an estimate was given for photo-\\nchemical dispersion models of +50Z. This estimate was based on the\\nassumption that the emission Inventories are in relatively good shape;\\nthat is, that the errors associated with the emission inventories are\\nsmall compared to the errors associated with the intrinsic behavior\\nof tile photochemical dispersion model. The number of +50%, then, does\\nnot really reflect the errors that could be associated with large\\npercentage errors in emissions inventory. AsimilAr estimate was made\\nfor the empirical kinetic modeling approach (EKMA). This estimate aqas\\n+70%. In the section where EKMA was compared with the linear rollback\\nmodel, it was shown that EKMA tended to be biased upward in terms of,\\nits emissions reductions in non-methane hydrocarbons. Referring back\\nto Fig. 4-6, for example, for low NMIIC/NOx ratios the EKMA model agreed\\nquite closely with the linear rollback model. For higher NHIiC/NOX\\nratios tile EKMA model was biased somewhat upward in terms of reductions\\ncompared to linear rollback. Hence, we estimate that the lower limit\\nof the rollback error Is comparable to the lower limit-, of the R*IA\\nmodel. The average difference between the EKMA model and tile linear\\nrollback model was as high as \\n\\'+ 30%. Hence, we estimate an u pper error\\n11mit foT the rollback model to ho 100%.\\nIn principle, statistical models shoi.^d be able to do same-\\nwh:,it better than linear rollback simply because they use some addi•\\nti,,6nal parameters. This of course will not be true for all statistical\\nmodels. A summary of tile uncertainties associated with these four\\ntypes\\', or models is shown in Fig. 4-14. It should be noted that Fig,\\n4-14 does not Include the impacts of potentially large errors in\\nomi8s.lous Inventory, for example, -1-60%.\\nin notual practice these models may agree better than\\nexpectod oil they basis or thlo inforilint foil shox,4i in Fig. 4-14.

This is important to do because the air quality\\nmeasurements are used as the basis for any kind of trend estimates. Air\\nquality measurement is still a.relatively young field. Hence, there\\nare changes being made in the instrumentation. These changes can have\\nboth quantitative and qualitative impacts on measurement trends. A\\nrecent discussion of air quality measurements appears in Ref. 5•-1. This\\ncritical review provides much of the background issues in air cuality\\nmeasurements. Since this material is covered so well there is ito point\\nin going over these issues in this report. In this section we examine\\nthe error limits imposed on several air quality measurements by agencies\\nsuch as the Environmental Protection Agency and the South Coast kir\\nQuality Management District, These examples will be best case examples\\nsince both organizations represent very advanced organizations from\\nthe viewpoint of measuring air quality. We shall examine measurements\\nof the oxides of nitrogen, non-methane hydrocarbons, and the implica-\\ntion of these measurements to the ratio of non-methane hydrocarbons\\nto NOx. We shall also examine the errors associated with ozone measure-\\nments,\\n5.1\\t NITROGEN DIOXIDE AND NITRIC OXIDE\\nIn order to determine how well a given air quality moni-\\ntoring instrument such as a nitrogen dioxide instrument is working,\\nstandards are brought into the air quality monitoring station and the\\nk\\t measurements on a given instrument are compared with the output of\\nthe standard. A certain set of rules is established to determine\\nwhether or not the instrument is within allowable error limits. As\\nan example of these rules, consider thc,rules given by the South Boast\\nAir Quality Management District (Ref. 5-1).\\nThe South Coast Air Quality Management District specifies\\nthat a set of calibrated values of NO 2 he checked against those measured\\nwith a monitoring instrument in the \"as found\" condition. This check\\nis done by fitting the best straight Line to a graph of output of the\\ninstruments vs the calibratiori values of NO 2. This fit is performed\\nby means of a linear regression approach. By means of linear regression\\nthe best values of slope and zero offset are determined. The air quality\\nmanagement district considers the data that the instrument has measured\\nsince its 14s\\'t check to be goad if (1) the offset is less than or\\nequal to +.03 ppm of NO 2, and (2) the slope deviates from unity by no\\nmore than +10%. An example of applying these two rules is shown in\\nFig. 5-1, The solid lines ate for the zero offset case, For example,\\nif the calibrated value of NO 2 was .05, the actual value could range\\nbetween .45 and .55 and be within the acceptable limits. The +.03\\noffset case is shown as short dashed lines in Fig. 5-1. In this case1,\\n\\'\"\\t 5-1\\nif the calibration value of NO2 is .5, the acceptable limits would be\\nbetween .48 and 58. A similar approach nppiies for a negative .03\\noffset producing the long dashed lines. Hence, if t1te regression lines\\nassociated with a given instrument fell w-11.00-n either of the three\\nbands, they would be acceptable. Thus, a Fiven instrument may have read-\\nings that fall In between the outer lines indicated by the calibration\\nerror bar at about .4 ppm from the calibration sy8tem. In actual prac-\\ntice, points may lie outside of these lines as long as the overall\\nslope and Intercept as determined by linear regression fall within the\\nspecifications of +10% on slope and +.03 ppm nit offset.\\nFig, 5-1 gives us a good indication of the in-practice\\nacceptable errors in NO2 measurements that are made by a well-qualified\\norganization. In this analysis the assumption will be made that these\\nouter limits represent approximately the +2 n limits for the measure-\\nments, that is, approximately 95% of the data falls within the calibra-\\ntion error mars shown in Fig. 5-1,\\nIt should be noted that the above discussion does not make\\nany comments about absolute accuracy of past NO2 measurements. In making\\nmeasurements of NO2 the calibrations have shifted significantly over\\nthe years. EPA had a very serious problem with th,\\'i Jacobs-Hochheiser\\ntechnique (Ref. 5-2) whi -1h vas ultimately rejected as a useful technique\\nfor measuring NO2 aftei o,*nv years of measurements (Ref. 5-3). Other\\napproaches such as the Saltzman approach and the gas phase Chemilumine-\\nscence approach have been used instead. The Chemilumineseence approach\\nto iweasurements of oxides of nitrogen has been designated by EPA\\nas Oie reference measurement principle (Ref. 5-4). The calibration\\ntechniques being used in advanced monitoring networks refer the Cali-\\nbrations back to National Bureau of Standards. A discussion of the\\nchanges in bias caused by shifting calibration standards is presented\\nin Refs. 5-5 and 5-6. In this discussion Crowe points out that in order\\nto ij ,;e 1975-79 California NOx data it must be multiplied by .83. This\\nis caused by a systematic bias in the calibration technique.\\nIf the calibration error limits are taken from Fig. 5-1\\nand divided by the calibration concentrations of NO2, a percentage error\\nthat is considered acceptable in practice as a function of the concen-\\ntration of NO2 is obtained. A plot of this acce ptable percentage error\\nvs the concentration of oxides of nitrogen is shown in Fig. 5-2. It\\nmay be seen that the error approaches +15% for relatively high values\\nof NO x 9 i.e., .7 ppm., Vor NO, values of the order of 0.2 ppm the error\\nis approximately +25%. For smaller concentrations the error becomes\\nincreasingly large, as is shown in Fig. 5-2. This curve will be used\\nlater in conjunction with a similar curve for the non-methane hydro-\\ncarbons, in order to assess the uncertainty in the ratio of non-methane\\nhydrocarbons to NOX,\\n_\\n^,\\n\\'\\ny\\t.\\n|\\n^\\'\\n!\\n0.7\\n0.6\\n^\\n0.4\\nUAbe\\n^ 0.3\\n^\\n\\'\\n^\\n^,\\n°\\n^\\n^\\t x0.1\\t 0^2\\t 0.3\\t 0.4\\t_\\tO~]\\t 0.0\\n\\'\\t [wn] \\t ,pp\" [`~^_\\'__\\'.—_\\n`\\nFig. 5-1. . ,Comparison of Measured vu-rau y Calibrated NO2\\nConcentrations Considering Calibration Error~0.\\nO0.1\\n0.(\\n^\\'\\n^^\\n./\\n50\\n30\\noc 10\\n0\\n-10\\n-30\\n-50\\n5-4Fig. 5-2.

The non-methane hydrocarbon instrument is\\nconsiderably poorer than the nitrogen oxides measurement described\\nearlier because the technique of measuring non-methane hydrocarbons\\nrequires the treating of many, many individual hydrocarbons as though\\nthey were quite similar. A discussion of this can be found in the EPA\\nResearch Triangle Institute report (Ref. 5-7). Tile Environmental Pro-\\ntection Agency, in the usern\\' manual for EKMA (Ref. 5-8) specifies\\nthe error associated with the non-methane hydrocarbon measurements as\\nbeing t5% to 10% of the 10 ppm full scale. If the +5% ,data is plotted\\nin a manner similar to that shown previously for the oxides of nitrogen\\nin Fig. 5-2, a curve shown in Fig. 5-3 is obtained.

Percent Error versus NMHC Concentratiop\\nIn order to check these curves, estimates that were made\\non 13 instruments by Scott Laboratories were used. The range of the\\nestimates is ::Frown in asterisks for 2 calibration values of non-methane\\nhydrocarbon, 2.90 ppmC and .25 ppmC. It may be seen that,,these range\\nestimates fall quite close to the estimate based on the error estimate\\nof +5% of full scale as specified in the EPA document. This is not..too\\nsurprising since the range can be used as an estimate of the standard\\ndeviation. For example, see Dixon and Maxxey (Ref. 5-9). For a sample\\nsize of 13 measurements, the standard deviation would be about .30 times\\nthe range. I.n keeping with the concept of 90% of the data falling\\nwithin an error bar, we would use twice the standard deviation, that is,\\n.60 times the range.\\nIn practice, a value of non-methane hydrocarbons of 1 ppmC,\\nwhich is not unusually low in the Los Angeles area has an error range\\nfrom Fig. 5-3 of +60%. In order for the South Coast Air Basin to reach\\nthe ozone standard, it is expected that the non-methane hydrocarbons\\nneed to be reduced to about .5 ppmC. At this concentration the error is\\napproximately +130%. Hence, it can be seen that the errors in non-\\nmethane hydrocarbons are quite significant at concentrations of interest\\nto air quality managers,\\n5-5\\nThere is a significant need to improve the abilities of\\ninstruments to measure nor.--meLhsne hydrocarbons. The present generation\\nof instruments appears to be considered dangerous and also highly inoc-\\ncurate at the concentration levels of interest, An indication of the\\nfrustration of air quality investigators with the performance of non-\\nmethane is given in Ref, 5-10.\\nIn summary, it is my conviction that whereas VID\\'s probably\\nrespond reasonably uniformly to ?paraffins they vary significantly\\nIn their response to olefins, acetylenes, aromatics and other\\norganIcs such as the alcohols, ketones and aldehydes. Present\\nInstrumentation does not allow legitimate comparison of total\\nhydrocarbon less methane data collected by gas chromaLographs\\ndesigned to produce those data, such as the Beckman 680G, Bendix\\n8200, and Byron 2DO series or the MSA 11-2 and the Bendix 8201.\\nTo add to the complexity of the above stated problem is\\nthe recognized fact that the photochemical reactivit y of different\\nhydrocarbons varies ,remendously.\\nIt is my belitJ EPA muHt face tip to the stated problem.\\nThere are solutions. But Irrespective of the solution, I can not\\nforesee any being free of arbitration. Until a solution is agreed\\nupon, and backed i , y sound research, perpetuation \"of any numerical\\nconcentration limits for hydrocarbons corrected for Methane now\\nnppents Inane. Within this past week I have seen one analyzer\\nproduce rendings that avvraged for ono hour a Value Of 0.22 ppm\\ncarbon and another analyzer producing a value in excess of an\\naverage of I ppin for the same Limo , period for the same air\\n*rt)ese errors associated with NMHC measurement instruments\\ndo have qualitative Impacts on decis-ton making in air quality management.\\nHence considerable effort should be given by the Environmental 1 1rotec-\\ntIon Agency to improve \\tability of these instruments to measure\\nnon-moLhane hydrocnrbons more precisely,\\n5.3\\t NKHC/NOx RATIO\\nWe hove examined the errors associated with routine opera-\\ntion of both Oxides of nitrogen instruments and non-wm) ,,thane hydrocarbon\\ninstruments, In tile EKMA model one of the fundamental tools used is\\nthe ratio of the non-methane hydroctirbon to the oxides of nitrogen\\nUMHC/NO,. Since this ratio is so critical to the EIM analysis we\\nstiall examine it and determine the errors In the ratio as determined\\nby the errors in both instruments for measuring NOx and the instrument\\nfor measuring the non-methane hydrocarbons, In Eq. (5-1) we let T equal\\nthe ratio of non-methane hydrocarbons to oxides of nitrogen.\\nNMHCT NO X\\n5-6\\nIf we perform a standard terror analysis on T in terms of the errors in\\nether components we find that\\n(5-2)AT - 3NMI4C A (NMIIC) * i\\t A (Nnx)x\\nIf Eq.

Since the nominal ratio is 5 to 1,\\nthe value of NMHC/NOx ranges between the values of 2.2 and 7.8, which\\nare shown as dote on Fig. 5-6. By repeating this process, lower and\\nupper bounds are obtained to doscribe the limits associated with the\\nnominal ratio of 5-1. Once again as values of NMHC approach these\\nexpected in ambient air in many urban areas, one finds very large errors\\nin the ratio of NMHC to NOx.\\n5.4\\t OZONE MEASUREMENTS\\nA discussion of the ozone reference measurement methods is\\npresented in Ref. 5-11. Ozone has had considerable changes in the way\\nin which it was measured. Early measurements were made with phenotha-\\nlene. This was replaced by measurements using potassium iodide. Some\\ninvestigators would buffer the potassium iodide, other investigators,\\nsuch as the Los Angeles Air Pollution District, would use unbuffered\\npostassium iodide. This resulted in a considerable difference in read-\\nings between the California Air Resources Board and the Los Angeles\\nAir Pollution Control District at nearby stations. A study was con-\\nducted several years ago which basically led to the elimination of this\\nproblem by means of shifting the technique for measuring ozone to a\\n5-10\\nphotometric technique. Presently the photometric technique is used in\\nmany measuring areas. Results of the 03 instrument errors that are\\nconsidered acceptable in practice using this photometric technique have\\nbeen supplied by John Higachi of the South Coast Air Quality Management\\nDistrict (Ref. 5-1). In making checks of the instruments used in the\\nair quality monitoring network by the South Coast Air Quality Management\\nDistrict during 1979, 53 calibration checks were made. The results of\\nthese checks indicated that the mean deviation of the instruments from\\nthe standards (which are referred back to the National Bureau of\\nStandards) was .2 1ft. in a measurement of the mean, positive errors tend\\nto cancel negative errors. Perhaps a more meaningful measurement is\\nthe standard deviation associated with a comparison of the actual\\nmonitoring instruments and the reference standards. In this case a\\nstandard deviation of 6% was obtained,\\nAnother approach used for ozone instruments is to make a\\nplot of the concentration measured with the monitoring instrument vs\\nthe concentration obtained through the reference standard. If these\\nvalues agreed perfectly, the result of this plot would be a 45° line\\nwith the slope equal to 1. One indication of the degree of difference\\nbetween the two would be to measure the slope of such a curve. This is\\nparticularly useful in the case of ozone measurements since zero off-\\nsets with the ultraviolet photometric instruments are usually quite\\nsmall. Such an investigation has been conducted by the South Coast\\nAir Quality Management District and the results are presented In\\nFig. 5-7. This figure shows a plot of the percentage error in the ozone\\nslope as a function of tbv cumulative percentage of the measurements\\nwhich have a slope error Ness than or equal to the values shown. By\\nexamining rig. 5-7 one sees that 60% of the measurements have a slope\\nerror which is less than 15%, and approximately 93% of the measurements\\ni\"%\\nMEAN OF DEVIATIONS+ 0.2%\\nSTANDARD DEVIATION = 6%\\n115%\\nit\\n0\\nW1\\nCr\\n+Z110%\\npUpc^\\nCK\\nyWy\\nf{`\\nis%\\n0\\t 20\\t 40\\t 60\\t BO\\t 100\\nCUMULATIVE % OF MEASUREMENTS\\nFig. 5-7.

This indicates that\\nthe relative errors in ozone measurements are quite small in compari-\\nson with those for the oxides of nitrogen, and in particular for those\\nin non-methane hydrocarbons. Hence, it does not appear that the measure-\\nment of ozone causes any qualitative impact on air quality management.\\n5.5\\t AIR QUALITY TRENDS\\nWhether the air quality in a given region is improving,\\nstaying the same, or degrading is typically determined by the use of\\nair quality trends. These trends are determined by taking measurements\\nand plotting these measurements for various years to determine whether\\nchanges are taking place. The many factors that affect air quality\\nconcentrations have been discussed previously, e.g., see Fig. 4-8 in\\nSection 4. The air quality is determined by the meteorology, the emis-\\nsions, and the chemistry that occurs. If one basically ignores these\\nthree major inputs and simply plots a curve of air pollutant concentra-\\ntion vs year, one may arrive at surprising results. For example, in the\\ndata shown in Fig. 5-8 it was concluded in 1976 that indeed the air\\nquality iii the South Coast Air Basin was improving dramatically. This\\nconclusion was based on a simple extrapolation of the end points of the\\ngraph. \\'lnfortunately, it turned out that in the subsequent years the\\nair quality worsened such that the conclusions drawn on the basis of\\nFig. 5-8 were inappropriate.\\n72\\n64 °\\nste\\ne\\n°\\to\\t °\\t SLOPE = -0.042 PPM/YEAR\\n49 °\\t s\\no\\n40- e\\n0\\nj,\\n32e\\t \\\\\\no t0 MOs.\\\\\\\\t\\n24- \\\\\\\\\\n141\\n\\\\\\\\ CALIFORNIA 1 -  HOUR STANDARD .10 PPM \\t \\\\^\\nf FEDERAL 1 - ROIRI STANDARD .011 PPM\\nO\\n^ 1966\\t 1902\\t it{t\\t 1170\\t 1874\\t 1976\\t 1962\\nYEAR\\nFig.5-8.\\tOxidant Trend Annual 1 - Hour Maximum,\\nEast San Gabriel Valley\\nNOTE;This figure is copied from a 1975 publication\\ndescribing oxidant trends in the South Coast Air\\nBasin.\\tAs shown, the slope of the \"projected\"\\nline is very sensitive to the number of yearst`used in its determination. \\t (SCAPCD 1975)\\n5\\'-12\\nAt a recent conference on long range trends at Caltech\\n(Ref. 5-12), it was concluded that very little, if any, improvement\\nhas occurred in air quality in the South Coast Air Basin over the past\\n15 years. However, this conclusion was not based simply on fitting a\\ncurve to the data. For example, an analysis was performed by G. Cass\\net al. (Ref. 5-13) to adjust the air quality data for meteorological\\nfactors such as those shown in Fig. 4-8 in Section 4. Cass\\'s analysis\\nincluded adjusting the data for inversion height, radiation intensity,\\nwind speed and temperature. No attempt was made to include the effects\\nof cloud cover or turbulence directly. This analysis indicated that\\n70% of the variability in data could be accounted for on the bamis of\\nthe above meteorological factors. The equation that waa used to) adjust\\nfor the variability is shown in Eq. (5-5).\\nf1\\t\\n03 a K10.74 F(T) 1.58\\t(5-5)\\n.46\\t 0.40\\nU\\t Z\\nwhere K1 is the sunlight dependent rate constant described in Section\\n4.2, U is the average wind speed, Z is the ii1\\'version height, and F(T)\\nis a temperature-dependent chemical reactivity. The exponents used in\\nEq. (5-5) were chosen to statistically maximize the correlation coeffi-\\ncient. Taking the total derivative of the ozone in Eq. (5-5), one finds\\nthat the percentage change in ozone concentration can be expressed\\nas Eq.

Seinfeld makes no\\nestimates of the error in the function of tempeeature. For the sake of\\nthis analysis let\\'s assume that the error in the function of tempera-\\ntune is on the order of +5X. If these errors are substituted into\\nEq. (5-7), one arrives at an overall net error due to errors in these\\nmeteorological factors of +21.6X.\\nThus, this example shows the intrinsic complex.ty of\\nadding arrors which are independent errors in a complex system.

(5-5) or Eq.\\n(5-8), a highly significant amount of the variability is accounted for\\nby meteorological factors. Hence, these results argue strongly that\\nit is quite useful to adjust the air quality monitoring trend data in\\norder to account for the effects of changes in meteorology from year to\\nyear.\\n5-14\\nThis section has examined the air quality management\\nuncertainties due to ambient air pollution monitoring instrumentation.\\nIn earlier sections the influences of uncertainties in emissions inven-\\ntories and modeling were presented.

Air quality models determine what decreases in NOX\\nand HC emissions are required in order to meet, for example, the air\\nquality standards for ozone and nitrogen dioxide. Various strategies may\\nTie  examined to effect these reductions. Each strategy, such as reducing\\nemissions from stationary sources, may be accomplished through a set of\\nspecific tactics. Each tactic produces a given emissions reduction.\\nThese required emission reductions are examined in terms of their con-\\ntrol cost. The control costs are associated with various strategies\\nand various tactics within each strategy. Typically, these costs may\\nbe expressed in terms of dollars per ton reduced. Hence, if the $/ton\\nfor a given control tactic is considerably more expensive than that of\\nother tactics, it will be rejected. Other control. factors may have poli-\\ntical limitations on their acceptability. Hence, the politics which\\ngovern a given region may pose severe limitations on tactics which are\\napplicable to that region. For example, the development of an acceptable\\ninspection and maintenance plan has not yet succeeded in California.\\nThe Clean Air Act amendments of 1977 require that reasonable\\nfurther progress be measured in terms of the emissions. This is to be\\ndone on an annual basis. Hence, these measurements may give new\\ninsights into air quality management and may act as restraints on cer-\\ntain option. ,;. And, last but not least, are the various measurements of\\nair quality. After all, air quality is what this is all about. As was\\nnoted in Chapter 5, these air quality measurements should be adjusted\\nfor meteorology in order that the annual and seasonal trends be more\\nmeaningful. This entire process acts to limit the options which might be\\napplicable to solving a given region\\'s air quality problem. A schematic\\ndiagram of this process is shown in Fig. 6-1.\\nIt should be noted that this pTocess d oes not occur simply\\nonce. The process should be one in which these ai lt luality management\\nfactors are being continuously evaluated. In particular, new evaluations\\nwould be appropriate with each reasonable further progress report.\\nHence, the system really is a moving system in which the air quality\\nproblem is continuously changing. The models may change, the political\\nclimate may change, and the meteorology may change. Hence, the basis of\\nair quality management is a time-dependent organic system with multiple\\nLevels of feedback.\\nIn this section, a summary of the air quality management approaches\\nis made for the three regions under consideration, i.v,, the South\\nCoast Air Basin, the Denver Air Basin, and the Phoenix Air Basin. The\\nimplications of the earlier sections of this report on these air quality\\nmanagement approaches are mentioned in the appropriate places.\\n6-1\\nFEASIBLE\\nAIR {\\t 8\\nQUALITY ;\\'t:i:i\"` \\' Eiiii :\\tEFFECTIVE\\nPROBLEM OPTIONS\\nPOTENTIAL\\nSOLUTIONCONTROL \\tPOLITICALOPTIONS COST, S/Ion\\tACCEPTABILITYAIR O\\n3\\tNO\\n2STD STD TACTICS \\t RFP\\t QUALITY TRENDS\\n`-- r--^ FOR\\t ADJUSTED FORAIR QUALITY EMISSIONS METEOROLOGYMODELS -----r\\nCHECKS\\nFig. 6-1. Partial Set of \"Decision Making Windows\"\\nWhich Influence Air Quality Management\\n6.1\\t EMISSIONS INVENTORIES\\nThe emissions inventories for the three regions under con-\\nsideration are described in the references cited previously for these\\nstate implementation plans. Each region has estimates of the emissions\\nof the primary pollutants such as S0 2, NOx, reactive hydrocarbons, etc.,\\nwhich impact the region\\'s air quality. However, none of the three\\nregions studied were able to estimate the degree with which they were\\ncertain of the emissions. That is to say, the uncertainties in the\\nemissions inventories are uncertain. Some insight into the uncertainties\\nfor stationary sources in the South Coast Air Quality Management Dis-\\ntrict can be obtained through quotL_Ion from the SIP process review done\\nfor the National Commission on Aix Quality (Ref. 6-1).\\nBecause of the complexity and size of the stationary source\\nemissions inventory data base, it is difficult to quantify prob-\\nlem5 and errors associated with this inventory. Over 40,000 data\\nentries are included in the stationary source computerized\\nemissions data base, and many of the data entries are very old\\n(i.e., many date back as far as the 1950\\'x). Uncert;Ainties in this\\ndata base can be classified into the following thr/Ae areas of\\npotential error.i\\n(1)Errors in the computer data base.\\n(2)Omissions, of certain equipment categories from the\\ndata base.\\n(3)Cross estimates made because of the lack of data.\\nOne estimate by KVB Corporation of the average degree of\\nuncertainty in the stationary source emissions inventory is as\\nfollows:\\n(1)+45% for NOX.\\n(2)+60% for total hydrocarbons.\\nBased on the scatter of the\\'data points shown in Section 2\\nof this report, and also based on the rather low correlation coeffi-\\ncients that were found in terms of emissions vs vehicle miles traveled\\n(correlation coefficient`s less than or equal to .3), it is assumed\\nthe error in the mobi.le\\',.lource inventory is at least this size. In the\\ncase of the mobile emission sources, the error is compounded by the fact\\nthat the sources move, and their locations can only be estimated by\\ntransportation models which also have a certain degree of error.\\nThe authors of this report have not been able to get estimates of\\nthe errors associated with the emissions inventories from either the\\nSouth Coast Air Quality Management District or the Air Pollution\\nControl Division of the State of Colorado or the Arizona Department of\\nTransportation simply because the personnel who would have this infor-\\nmation do not know the answers. In order to determine such information,\\nextensive manpower would be required which would require both dollars\\nand time. These resources simply have not been available. Hence, in\\ntrackir,f; the reasonable further progress in terms of emissions from\\nyear to year, we simply are uncertain about the uncertainty in the\\nemissions. This situation then causes a highly significant uncertainty\\nin terms of analysis of reasonable further progress. In order to minimize\\nthese uncertainties, it appears that it may be necessary for the Con-\\ngress to modify the Clean Air Act in such a way as to require that\\nnot, only the emissions be estimated for a region on a yearly basis,\\nbut that the uncertainties in those emissions also be estimates. If the\\nCongress imposes such ? requirement on the Air Quality Management\\nDistricts, it would be possible for the Congress to supply the funds\\nwhich are required to determine these uncertainties. An alternate\\napproach to supplying these funds would be to increase or, in many\\ncases, initiate emission fees on stationary and/or mobile sources of\\nemissions \\'of air pollutants.\\nIn the case of estimates of the reductions of future emis-\\nsions, there is some information available from the Southern California\\nAssociation of Governments on their estimates of the uncertainties in\\nvarious tactics. These emission uncertainties are expressed in terms of\\nboth cost of control and also the confidence range of emission reduction\\nestimates. A discussion paper (Ref. 6-2) contains the following\\nstatement:\\n6-3\\nILLti\\nThe quantitative estimates made in these three categories\\nhave varying levels of precision and accuracy. Notwithstanding\\nthe use of the most up-to-date data base methodologies, all\\nquantitative analysis underlying the AQMP is subject t p, some\\nuncertainty. To address this uncertainty, confidence ranges sur-\\nrounding the cost and emission reduction calculations have been\\nestimated based on staff judgment....\\nThe overall reliability of the AQMP (Air Quality Management\\nPlan) inventory has not been assessed quantitatively and there\\nare no available quantitative estimates of the confidence ranges\\nassociated with the emission factors for each source type, The\\nAQMP inventory reflects the latest revisions to emission factors\\napproved by EPA and is the basis for estimating the emissions\\nreduction potential of alternative measures (note that in AP-42,\\ncacti emissions factor is qualitatively ranked on a scale of I to\\n5). Overall, the inventory is generally considered to be the most\\ncomprehensive of Its kind ever done in the South Coast Air\\nBasin. ;\\n*ncertainties in each of these areas have been assessed and\\nthe overall confidence ranges of all. recommended tactics are pre-\\nsented in Tables I and 2, Ttut confidence ranges of 0-20% +, 20\"\\n50%, and greater than 50% themselves reflect the qualitative\\nJudgment of technical staff and are not meant to portray an abso-\\nlute degree of precision.\\nThis type of approach appear ,; to be a Step in than right\\ndirection. However, It IS a Step that is clearly needed for the present\\ninventory as well as for projections towards fuLu lre inventories. Since\\nwe have seen that the emissions inventories for both stationary sources\\nand mobile sources are determined largely by modeling considerations,\\ntile estimates of any uncertainties In these emissions inventories would\\nalso be determined by means of Similar models. The data base that has\\nbeen presented In this report Indicates the need to improve our know-\\nlodge of tile major components of the emission inventory models.\\nIn the Phoenixkjir Quality Region, the ( ,laim is made that the\\nauto inspection maintenance program has reduced the emissions of car-\\nhon monoxide by 22% from 1976 to 1977 (Ref. 6-3). Similar reductions\\nhave been reported for New Jersey (Ref. 6-3, P. 3). In the Denver region\\nand the South Coast Air Basin, inspection and maintenance programs are\\nhaving n difficult time getting Started. In the Denver region, tile\\ninspection and maintenance program that was put into effect did not\\nrequire compulsory repair of an ,into tf,lat was found to be outside of the\\nInspection limits. This lack was rul.ed\\'to be unacceptable by tho\\nEnvironmental Proo-Actian Agency, and hence the economic sanctions men-\\ntioned in the introduction of this report were imposed on the Denver\\narea. ^hese Sanctions will, hopefully, be lifted as soon as the State\\nof Colorado inserts a requirement for ,,onie level of repair upon failure\\nof the emissions test.\\nin the state of California, the topic of inspection and\\nmaintenance  hams received considerable debate and is the subject of\\nconsiderable political controversy. Several proposed bills in bath the\\nstate assembly and the state senates have failed to date. At present, no\\nmajor construction which requires EPA permi.tsa can be initiated within\\nthe South Coast Air Basin,\\n6,2\\t AIR QUALITY TRENDS\\ni\\nit has been shown earlier In than report that It Is very\\ndifficult to determine the progress in Improving air duality by simply\\nplotting air quality trends. This difficulty Ira caused by the wide \\t !\\nfluctuations in meteorology that may oeru! from year to year. It has\\nbon suggested that this problem can hei reduced significantly by ad,just-\\nIng the data for meteorological factors in the manner suggested by\\nCass c*t ail„ as disvussod In Section la of this report.

Some indicotion of the error bars\\nassociated with the model-,; discussed earlier (for emission Inventories\\nwhich are assumed to be quite accurate, and ignoring meteorological\\nuncertainties) Is shown In Fig. 6-3, a plot, of the maximum hourly ave-\\nrage --if ozone vs years into the ruLur y for the South Coast Air Basin.\\nThe measured ozone value shown for 1979 represtu)nts the very bad ,epi-\\nsodes that occurred in September of 1979. The error bars associated with\\nthose measurements are derived from Section 5. In 1982, a hypothetical\\npoint is predicted of about .33 ppm maximum hourly average for ozone.\\nThis prediction would have different error bars associated with it\\ndepending on which modes;. were used. For example, If to photochemical dis-\\npersion model were used which had it 50% uncertainty, the large black,\\nerror bars would result. Ilowevvr, Lf the RKMA model were used with Its\\nnominn) 4-70% uncertainty, the thin error bars would result. Hence, In\\nboth cases, the spread of the data is quite Inrge.\\nThe 81tUaLion Changes 80111L IWI►L If we extend the concept of\\npredivtton out to 1987 where It Is shown that the ozone national ambient\\nair quality Is met. In this rase, the error bars for bath tll (, photo\\'\\nchemical dispersion model and the EMMA model are relatIvel y small In\\nabsolute value. Hence, one can use these kinds of models to predict\\ngross changes, with confl.dence, such as Ltiose showil iron , about .45 In\\n1979 to .12 In 1987, however, for periods In between where the absolute\\nvalue of the prediction i, ,i larger, the errors tire vorrespondingly\\nInrger. Hence a combination of emissions reductions measurements and\\nair quality measurements (adjusted for meteorologIcAl factors) would be\\nuseful to determine If the air quality management tooliniques that are\\nbeing used are successful.\\n6-6\\n0 MEASURED VALUE\\n).S\\t 0 PREDICTED VALUE\\nPHOTO CHEMICAL\\nDISPERSION MODEL\\nERROR\\n).1 v \\t SANDS \\t EMMA\\n*ow MEASURED\\n\"AsQ\\n!.3\\nNAAQS\\n0 L...\\nYEAR\\nFig. t,—\\'l. \\ttay>ono F:t°rtli !land i st i matos for South\\nCo\"1st Mt,asul •t,mt\\'nt s ata(l Mode h4\\nSeveral viiiission—alir finality models exist that are i-Aliaablt,\\nIn hrincipt y of pI-OdIctIng the Impact of trainsportatton systems on\\namblont itIr tluallty iii a gf.ven AOMU, fn I)i-net,Ive, tlie ch it\\' t LIIffIcultV\\nof pretticting ii pnots l it\\'s nuitilly\\' In tut, 104 .90 1111CCI-01111t IeS In 1)(11 111\\ntacit emissions tnwntorit s, In mctoorulcigiv,,il tintaa, in i •aitrs of chvinlcall\\nreactions tit\" Hit, lard tntants in the ntmospliel\\'o, and -iii the mea,uroments\\ntit atmbit\\'nt Air quality It-self, Ili tliosr AQMD\\'s wliort , mobile source,\\nare i-c,honsibt y for most (if the pollutantts, the unoortaiinty Ili oml„luns\\nOf re\\'a etivo hydrocarbons may lie +700 u1 tilt , mean. 11twort.aint_it,, In\\nmietoorology, (twhidi_ng aivora gv Wind Speed, 110ght of tilt , base (if tilt\\ninversion layer, ,un11ght intellsit\\' •, anti annhit\\'nt tolliperatilro offects,\\nload to an \"terror\" ear i11WOI •tatntl • of -i-„77, llncertaai-ntlos in lulttat\\nconditions rind clioniica t react i on rates airs • +S0%.

An example of this uncertainty is applied tc\\nERMA in Fig. 6-4. A similar analysis has been performed by Eschenroader\\n(Ref. 6-4), in which the percentage errors of NMiC and NO, measurement\\nhave been assumed to be independent of the concentration of the\\npollutants. The ozone isopleths that are shown in this figure have\\nbeen adjusted specifically for the South Coast Air Basin. Hence, they\\nappear to be quite different than those seen before in Section 4 on\\nmodeling. Two years of interest are shown on tile diagram---1974 and\\n1987. In the air quality management plan submitted by the South Coast\\nAir Quality Management District and the Southern Callfornia Association\\nof Governments, 1974 was used as the base year. The non-methane hydro-\\ncarbon value for the peak oxidant day was 1.5 ppmC, and the NOX value\\nwas approximately 0.4 ppm. The shaded box indicates the combined effect\\nof error bars in both NO, and hydrocarbons. It may he , seen that the\\navtual valite of ozone could lie at values as low its tile air quality\\nstandard and possibly as high as value,; of about .7, which is not\\nshown on the grapil. Hence, the relative degree of uncertainty in the\\nmeasurements of both Nox and NMHC causes considerable uncertainty in\\nterms of tile starting point.\\nAs the attempt is made t(\" meet till\\' \\tamblent standard\\nfor ozone in 1987, a nominal point of about .5 ppmC for non-methane\\nhydrovarbon,41 and about .23 for NOX is reached. Once again, considerable\\nerror Is shown III the viilue of tion-itiethant , hydrocarbon, which cotild\\nlie within it 1-Mo-lignin limit t ,,xteiiding from 0 to I lipm. This range could\\neatise the value of ozone to vary from about .38 down to background.\\nThis instrument uncertainty causes significant uncertainty in terms of\\nthe air quality management devisionts that nitist be made. It should he\\nnoted that thest , uncertainty values were taken from the data III See-\\ntion 5, Measurements and Trends.

In other words, such violations\\nare by no means rare events. The assessment of the emissions air duality\\nmodels in this report shows that these models are poorly equipped to\\npredict rare events ilee\\'aUSe of the large Uneertaint:ios In the data base.\\nA more satisfactory approach is to retain the maximum hourly average\\nconvont rat ion (0.12 ppm 0 1) but utilize the number of days per year,\\nor 110111\\'S per year, that this standard is exceeded as a measure of\\nprogress toward achieving, the air duallty standards. For example, at cer-\\ntain stations In the South Coast Air Management District (California)\\nstich as Axusa, the previous Federal limit o t 0.05 ppm 03 was exceeded\\nabout 1 150 hours per ~ rear in l eap+, A \"management air c111a11itr standard\"\\n(Ref. 6-4) might specify that the number of hours per year should be\\nreduced in stages from 1350 hours per year to, for example, 100 hours\\nper vear by 1987. This approach would permit statistically robust\\nfeedback from the observed freyuvuvy of speci fied concentrations to the\\nprodOwd concentrations. Air qualit y managers could theft alter their\\nstrategies by accr`lerating; or doveleratIng, the planned ratvs of redur-\\ntions in emissions of specific pollutants.\\nh-c?\\nI\\nThis \"management standards\" approach based on technical,\\neconomic and social feasibility would set up practical milestones an\\nroute to cleaner air. A reduction in RUC and NOx emissions by a factor\\nof 2, in the South Coast Air Basin, over the period 1980-87, could\\nreduce the number of hours per year that the Federal level of 0.12 ppm\\nis exceeded by a factor of 10. A reduction of this magnitude is feasible\\nin the South Coast Air Quality Management District (lief, 6-5). The\\nconcept of a gradual but significant reduction in number of hours per\\nyear that the Federal level is exceeded may be extendeu, of course, to\\nall AQMD\\'s that presently violate the existing Federal standard.\\n6.4.2\\tUncertainties in Transportation Emission Sources\\nThe status of air quality management has been examined con-\\nsidering the uncertainties and expected errors in:\\n(1)Mobile sources emissions biased on surveillance and fac-\\ntory testing,\\n(2)Emissions caused by measurement variability.\\n(3)The model estimates for stationary sources using\\navailable averages and yearly measured data to model\\npeaks and hourly rates.\\n(4) \\'Travel demand foreensting using transportation network\\nmodels.\\nBased on the identified uncertainties in both the factory\\nand surveillance test results, it is important to estimate useful con-\\nfidence ranges for motor vehicles its a function of model year or mileage\\nfor each emission pollutant. The data taken in the CARB surveillance\\ntests indicate a large shatter. It should be nested that the CaAkB tests\\nhad the benefit of easing knowledge based on earlier tests and simulating\\nrenditions derived from the RYA Em issions raactor Test Program. One\\nnaaior concern is the lark of correlation in the data. This lack of\\ncorrelation may be due to the single test per car that is run for each\\nof the mileage Intervals. The factory testing bears this out because\\nof the large vaariaabi l ity in dataa from repeated tests on the :name car\\nunder the same conditions. The factor y toast data showed showed a +33% v<ar-\\niaabillty at the 951 confld,enco limit for CO test results due to the\\ncombined effects of measurement error and v.rhicle variability.\\nThe large demonstrated uncertainty (% variability) in faac-\\ntory test data Is :supported by the large deviations, shown from surveil.-\\nlaanc •e test data. In one case, the results from Ref. 6 -6 for a sample\\nof 53 1975 model N-ear California mars showed as mean of 2.3 g/mi a^ \\'ud as\\nstandard devintion of 1.7 g/mi of HC exhaust emission. However, the\\nsame set of tests for 1979 ears Yielded much smaller value for bath the\\nmean (0.9 (0.5 g/mi) and the standard deviation (P.4 g/mi). Two additional\\nImportant Points obtained from the exaaminaation of this data aare.\\nE\\tC,-1(1\\ni\\n(1) the use of Gaussian statistics to analyze the data is misleading\\nas shown in these cases where the standard deviation is approximately\\nequal to or greater than the mean, and (2) the percent of cars passing\\nthe tests was significantly improved by the newer models. This improve-\\nment in reducing emissions as demonstrated by the new cars may have+\\';a\\nsignificant impact on the effectiveness of I/M over the next 5-10 years.\\nTwo recent regulations issued by the EPA will assist motor-\\nists in states that have adopted I/M as part of their air quality\\nplans (Ref. 6-8). The regulations established an EPA approved emissions\\ntesting method of cars to determine if light vehicles after 1981 exceed\\ntailpipe standards. This short test, which is used to screen in-use\\n\"warm\" cars for further evaluation or return to manufacturer for\\nrepairs, will place the burden on the manufacturer to have better con-\\ntrol and to minimize early emission control system problems.\\n6.5\\t SUMMARY\\nIn this section, the findings of the report are summarized.\\nSome of these findings have led to conclusions, and some conclusions\\nappear to warrant recommendations. Th\\'e conclusions and recommendations\\nare also found in this section.\\n6.5.1\\tFindings\\nA wide variety of findings have been determined in this\\nreport. In this summary we shall concentrate only on the major findings.\\nWe have found that the uncertainties i• emission inventory are uncertain\\nfor both stationary sources and for mobile sources. We have found that\\nthe instrumentation available to measure both oxides of nitrogen and\\nnon-methane hydrocarbons has considerable errors in mOgsurement. We\\nhave found that the air quality models examined have e ,Xors which range\\nfrom +1001 to -701 for linear rollback to _+50% for photihchemical dis-\\npersion modeling. It should also be noted that these error estimates\\nassume that the errors in the emission inventories are negligible com-\\npared to the errors in the model per se. This assumption does not appear\\nto be warranted.\\nWe have found that introducing increased complexity in a\\nmodel does not nee-essarily decrease the total error. In fact, as com-\\nplexity increases beyond that warranted by the state of measurements,\\nthe overall error produced by the model increases. We have found that\\nit is very ;,lifficult to get unbiased estimates of either precision of\\nair quality models or their accuracy. We have found that there may be a\\nneed to reassess non-methane hydrocarbon reduction strategies since\\nsome hydrocarbons appear to be much more reactive than others, The\\ninspection and maintenance programs for automobiles have been found to\\nproduce significant reductions in emissions,\\nr\\n6.5.2\\tConclusions\\nWe have concluded that it would be r equite beneficial to air\\nquality managers if they knew the uncertaintieOin the emission inven-\\ntories. This knowledge could be used as a basis 4or im proving the amis-\\nsion inventories both in terms of estimating tT* most likely value and\\nalso in formulating strategies to reduce the uncertainties. This esti-\\nmate of uncertainties could focus the effortsiof the individual control\\nagencies toward reducing the uncertainties ff m year to year,. We have\\nconcluded that the measurement uncertainties in both NO X and non-methane\\nhydrocarbon are large enough to cause significant uncertainties in the\\nuse ofair quality models.\\nWe have concluded that it would be quite useful to have a\\nstudy which would determine the total error for a given model as a func-\\ntion of complexity so that a given air quality management district\\ncould choose a model of the complexity which would minimize its errors\\nin terms of air quality management. We have concluded that there is a\\nneed to specify both the precision and the accuracy for air quality\\nmodels. At present, we cannot find these , specified in an unbiased man-\\nner. We have concluded that measurements of reasonable further progress\\nare hampered by the lack of estimates of the uncertainties associated\\nwith the emission inventories. We have concluded that automobile\\ninspection maintenance can produce significant reductions in air emis-\\nsions for the three regions under consideration.\\nThe present Federal ambient air quality standard for )xidant\\nexpressed in terms of a maximum hourly average concentration not to be\\nexceeded more than one day per year is based,on effects on human\\nhealth. We have concluded that the uncertainties associated with the\\ntools presently available for air quality management render these tools\\ninadequate to accurately predict such a rare event. We recommend that\\nserious consideration be given by the EPA to replacing the present pro-\\ncedure by a \"management standards\" approach that is statistically\\nrobust. This approach would sea: up milestones on the way to clean air\\nin terms of hours per year that the Federal standard is exceeded in\\nthose AQMD\\'s that presently violate the Federal standard by a large\\nmargin. For example, a reduction of 50% in the number of hours per year\\nthat the Federal level is exceeded might be mandated for the period\\n1979-1983. An additional reduction of 75% in the remaining number of\\nhours per year that the Federal level is exceeded might be mandated for\\nthe period 1983-1987. This approach would permit essential feedback tv\\nair quality managers responsible for planning the required reductions\\nin emissions of specific pollutants.\\nREFERENCES\\t\\n6-1\\tNational Commission on Air Quality, Los Angeles Regional\\nStudy - SIP Process Review, Executive Summary by Systems\\nApplications, Inc., ACUREX Corporation, and Energy and\\nEnvironmental Analysis, Inc., Feb. 1980, Draft Report\\n80-46/EE, pg. 4-3.\\t\\n6-2\\t\"Discussion Paper--An Assessment of the Uncertainty in the\\nAnalysis of Recommended AQMP Measures,\" Southern California\\nAssociation of Governments, Paul Wuebben to T.

TESTING AND MODELIW\\' °,\\nB.1\\t TEST METHODS AND PROCEDURES\\nTest methods and procedures pertaining to both regulated\\nemissions and fuel economy of LDV have been assessed by the National\\nAcademy of Sciences (NAS) through its Committee on Motor Vehicle\\nEmissions (CMVE) (Ref. B-1). Their findings were that the exhaust\\nreliability and reproducibility of emissions and fuel, economy measure-\\nments for LDV were strongly influenced by the specified test method\\nand procedures. In particular, the CVS-CH test methods and the 1975\\nFederal Test Procedure (FTP) were evaluated. The CVS-CH test cycle was\\nevaluated to determine how closely it approximates actual conditions in\\nan urban area and to estimate variations in emission results during the\\ntests.\\nThe intent of this examination eat, test methods and proce-\\ndures is to help DOT develop a detailed data base for the quantitative\\nassessment of the factors that influence control of emissions and fuel\\neconomy, The information will also be helpful in the development of\\nstandardized test methods and procedures that adequately demonstrate\\nemission control and fuel. economy.\\nOf particular interest was the conclusion that based on a\\ncomparison with five city composite cycle tests performed under the\\nCAPE-10 project, the CVS-CH test method using the Urban Dynamometer\\nDriving Cycle (UDDS) is a sufficiently accurate represencati.on of urban\\ndriving patterns to be used for purposes of determining LDV exhaust\\nemissions (Ref. B-1, p. 2) .\\nA brief discussion of the 1975 F\\'rP, the 2-;speed idle test\\nand the Federal three mode tests are presented below because much of\\nthe data is obtained through this type of test.\\n11.1.1\\t1975 Federal Test Procedure\\nThe 1975 FTP is described in 40 FR 126. The 1575 FTP\\nrequires a 12-hour soak at normal. room temperature before starting the\\nvehicle. The first five cycles, from time zero to 505 sec, are referred\\nto as the cold-start phase. Cycles 6 through 18 (505 to 1372 sec) are\\ncalled the stabilized phase. At the end of cycle 18, the engine is\\nswitched off for 10 min. The first five cycles are then repeated (i.e.,\\ncycles 19 through 23); this third phase is called the hot-start. To\\nobtain the official FTP emissions and fuel economy values, the data\\nfrom the cold-start and hot-start phases are weighted by factors of\\n0.43 and 0.57, respectively, to reflect estimated proportions of\\nin-use cold and hot starts. A detailed outline of the 1975 FTP is\\ndescribed in Ref. B-2.\\nB.1.2\\tTwo-Spee6 Idle Test\\nThe two-speed idle test consists of volumetric sampling\\nof undiluted exhaust emissions during two steady-state operating condi-\\ntions with the hood open and the cooling fan on. The first operating\\nmode is at 2500 engine rpm with the transmission in neutral. The second\\nmode is at normal idle with the transmission in neutral also.\\nTwo-speed idle tests are preceded by a 6-min soak period\\n(3 min with engine off and 3 with the engine idling). At the end of the\\nsoak period the vehicle is operated for a maximum of 3 min at 2500 rpm\\nand then at idle speed. At each speed, equilibrium of engine speed\\nand the CO, HC and NO analyzer output meters are maintained for 30 sec\\nbefore the readings are recorded. CO, HC and NO are measured and\\nreported in percent CO, ppm/hexane and ppm NO respectively. The rpm\\nshould be written on the trace for both operating conditions (Ref. B-3).\\nB.1.3 \\t Federal Three-Mode Test\\nThe Federal three-mode test procedure is preceded by a\\n6-min soak as described under the two-speed idle test. The test con-\\nsists of three steady-state operating modes from which undiluted\\nexhaust samples are taken. The dynamometer loads simulate the average\\npower that occurs at the appropriate speed on the FTP, with all light\\nduty vehicles being grouped into weight classes. At the end of the soak\\nperiod the vehicle is operated for a maximum of 3 min at the mode-\\nspecified speed with the hood open and the cooling fan on. The inertia\\nweight is set at 1750 lbs inertia. During this stabilization period the\\nspecified dynamometer load horsepower is set,\\nThe test is performed in the order of high cruise, low\\ncruise, and idle. The idle mode is sampled in both drive (automatic\\ntransmissions only) and in neutral. At each speed, equilibrium of\\nvehicle speed and the CO, HC and NOx analyzer meters are maintained for\\n30 sec before the readings were recorded. CO, HC and NOx are measured\\nand reported in percent CO, ppm/hexane and NO x ppm respectively. The\\ninstruments used for measurement of undiluted HC, CO and NO x emissions\\nwere the same as used for the two-speed idle test. Undiluted exhaust\\nemissions are measured by the volumetric procedure for each mode\\n(Ref . \\'B-3) .\\nB.2\\t FACTORY TESTING\\nTwo major types of factory testing are performed on LDV to\\ndemonstrate either compliance with regulations or capability of the\\nsystem to perform as designed. These tests are certification testing\\nand developmental testing. Certification testing of LDV is performed\\nas required by either Federal or State regulations for the current\\nmodel year as defined in Federal Register FR Vol 42, No. 124. Develop-\\nmental testing is performed generally by manufacturers to demonstrate\\nthat a particular emission control system will perform as designed and\\nwill meet or operate under the anticipated Federal Test Procedures. An\\nB-2\\nanalysis of the results from developmental tests is more useful in\\nthis study because an examination of uncertainties and variabilities in\\ntest results for different test conditions and car mileage can be made.\\nCertification testing is performed on new vehicles and practically all\\nmust pass depending on the regulations, or the car may go to a state\\nwith :less constraining emission regulations.\\t\\n8.2.1\\tCertification Testing\\nDuring this study no significant data base on the results\\nof certification tests was obtained; however, tesults of certification\\ntesting are available and should be assessed. Examination of certifica-\\ntion test results might lead tot\\n(1)Findings that 4:ould impact the procedures for\\ncertification of new vehicles.\\n(2)New vehicle tests that could be used to determine\\nthe nature of tie analytic approximation to extremely\\nlow mileage cars, 100-1000 miles. This information\\nmay be useful in de s^gloping 1/M requirements that\\ncould be the responsibility of dealers to repair\\ncomponents during initial use failure.\\t\\n8,2.2\\tDevelopmental Testing\\nEngine control and driveability for vehicles are problems\\ncontinuously being studied to minimize emissions and maximize fuel\\neconomy. Developmental testing underway as schematically shown in\\nFig. B-1 is producing results that demonstrate large variability among\\ntest vehicles. The emissions from these tests support the statistical\\ninferences made in appraising vehicles in actual use and explain Lite\\nlarge differences in surveillance test results. Engine control involves\\ncontrolling the characteristics of the engine through feedback and\\ndriveability involves controllers\\' ability to deliver commanded values\\nduring all phases of the tests. As an example of engine control\\nDohner (Ref. B-4) demonstrates how the amounts of HC, CO and NOx\\ndepend on the air-to-fuel ratio, spark advance, and exhaust gas recircu-\\nlation devices under highly controlled and continuously recorded condi-\\ntions. The results of Fig. B-2 show CO, HC and NOx variations for each\\nof these parameters using a 5.7 liter engine at 1600 rpm and 276 kPA\\nBMEP (break mean effective pressure). These figures show a continuous\\nresponse in the applied controls at the above speed-load conditions.\\nThe point is that significant variation in the emissions occur such\\nas the highly nonlinear behavior shown for CO as the A/F ratio changes\\nfrom just above 15 to 16. In order to show the influence of proper\\ncontrol using feedback, these tests were demonstrated to be repeatable\\n(see Ref:. B-4 p. 1315-1317, Fig. 4-1). The results of controlling,the\\nengine during the same speed-load conditions were then normalized after\\neach iteration. The initial emission measurements are shown as unity\\non Fig. B-3. The decrease for HC emission was more than 50%.

The variability in\\nemissions during actual operations by the driving public then could be\\neven larger and should be accounted for in the results of the surveil-\\nlance tests used to develop emission factors. The influence of sur-\\nveillance variability is discussed in Section B.3. Variability during\\nfactory testing is discussed below.\\nB.2.3\\tVariability of Exhaust Emissions Measurements\\nBoth systematic and 4andom errors associated with vehicle\\nvariability, emission collectioi: and measurement variability and\\nenvironmental variables contribute to the test variability of a single\\nvehicle.

The surveillance test results are primarily influenc-\\ning strategies for transportation management to meet current and future\\nstandards. The data from these tests have a significant bearing on plan-\\nning and demonstrating the need for an effective restorative mainte-\\nnance plan for the U.S., and especially for California as mandated in\\nthe CAAA 1977 because T/M will be imposed where other measures do\\nnot lead to satisfying emission standards and regulations on the ambient\\npollutions.\\nB-12\\n2\\n•The Restorative Maintenance Evaluation Program that EPA\\nstarted in 1976 is examining the poor emission performance of in-use\\nvehicles by investigating and quantifying individual and combined\\neffects of defects and disablements or maladjustments on exhaust emis-\\nsions and fuel economy. These results are specifically being used to\\n(1) assess the effectiveness of the LDV Certification Process in rela-\\ntionship to the performance of it-use vehicles, (2) improve require-\\nments for engines and emission control systems and (3) build information\\nfor planning I/M programs (Ref. 2-5).\\nA timely discussion on the further development of the data\\nbase to update the emission factors for catalyst-equipped California\\ncars that were estimated by EPA (Ref. B-6) in March 1978 `was reported\\nby CARB in Ref. B-7. The results of the CARB testsiare based on in-use\\npassenger cars rather than relying on certification or assembly line\\ndata. The EPA results, which are also used for comparison purposes,\\nwere based on tests of fleets of vehicles in customer service and upon\\nprototype testing. Both sets of test data evaluate the emissions per-\\nformance of in-use passenger cars, but it should be pointed out that\\nthe small amounts of in-use data leading to using averages of the test\\nsamples to data do not demonstrate significant correlation. A typical\\ncharacterization of the scatter of a small sample of data is demon-\\nstrated in Fig. B-10.\\nThe primary reason for comparing the earlier EPA emission\\nfactors with the more recent CARB emission data is to show:\\n3\\nI\\n(•\\n• ••\\n• i o • •_••^ • ^•\\'^^ •%h• • • 0 \\t • •• •\\n0\\t 10\\t 20\\t 30\\t 40\\t 50\\nODOMETER READING (MILES x 103)\\nFig. B-10.

Two features\\nthat are important to modeling and trend ,forecasting efforts are\\nclearly shown in Figs. B-11 and B-12. In Fig. B-11, the EPA data\\nindicates that the California cars would have met the California NOx\\nstandard up to about 30,000 miles while the CARB data shows that the\\naverage car will not meet the standard \"as received\" after being in-\\nuse, but the deterioration is not significant even out to 70,000 miles\\nif the cars are repaired based on evaluation of idle test results and\\nstandards established for the California T/M program.\\nThe contrast between the EPA and CARB 1977-1979 vehicle test\\ndata is more strongly shown in Fig. B-12. In this figure the EPA data\\nshows significant deterioration after meeting the standard up to about\\n25,000 miles, while the CARB data shows that the average car is not\\ndeteriorating relative to meeting the NO x standard. It further shows\\nthat the average repaired California car meets the California N0x\\nstandard.\\nThe HC emissions test data in Fig. B-13 shows that after\\n20,000 miles the 1975-1976 CARB cars typically do not meet the Calif-\\nornia emissions standard even after repair. Fig. B-14 shows that the\\n1977-1979 \"as received\" cars exceed the gtandard after approximately\\n8,000 miles.

Similar comments can be made for CO\\nemissions. Fig. B-16 shows that the CO emissions for both the repaired\\nCARB 1976-1976 cars and the \"as received\" 1977-1979 cars meet the\\nFederal CO standard. It also shows that the EPA 1975-1979 emission fac-\\ntor deterioration curve fits the 1977-1979 data better than the 1975-\\n1976 data. Since both the Federal and the California CO standards\\nhave remained constant from 1975 to 1979 (Fig. B-16), the improvement\\nin the 1977-1979 cars could be due to improvements in technology and\\nmanufacturing processes. The GARB \"as-received\" 1975-1976 cars do not\\nmeet the Federal standards after approximately 25,000 miles. If these\\n1975-1976 cars are repaired through the CARB I/M program, the average\\ncar meets the federal standard until 60,000 miles. At that point it\\nwould exceed the California standard by!\\'about 65%.\\nAbout 67% of the vehicles in-use now have odometer readings\\nof more than 50,000 miles; vehicle miles traveled by these vehicles\\nis 57%. These vehicles, however, contribute more than 74% of the LUV CO\\nemissions and 74% of the HC emitted (Ref. B-8.) Therefore, without\\nrepair the emissions from the total car population would be much larger.\\nThe influence of repair on HC emissions as well as the\\nimprovement in emission control systems is dramatically displayed in\\nFig. B-17 by the regression curves for the 1975-1976 cars vs 1977-1979\\ncars. Although California HC standards will not be met by the average\\nin-use vehicle, an effective I/M program could potentially reduce HC\\nemissions by almost a factor of 2 for the average car having 50,000\\nmiles on the odometer.\\n.long with this potential reduction in emissions expected\\nwith I/M, the influence of regular inspection could lead to improvements\\nin vehicle driving habits, effective use of emissions control mechanisms\\nand vehicle function. Specific factors such as these related to in-use\\nvehicles are discussed below to highlight their variability.\\nVariability of In-Use Vehicles and Uncertainty in Applying\\nAverage Emission Factors. Many factors such as driver operation,\\nemission control system, and traffic action and controls interact during\\nthe operation of a given vehicle in urban and suburban traffic to cause\\nlarge variations in exhaust and fuel consumption. Some of the more\\nrealistic variabilities lie in actual on-road use of the vehicles.\\nSome examples of how these factors influence the fuel consumption and\\nexhaust emissions of a vehicle in urban traffic are displayed to\\nexamine the practicability and reliability of these types of quantita-\\ntive data bases. In particular (Ref. B-9), a recent investigation by the\\nTraffic Science Department of General Motors Research Laboratories has\\nresulted in rather consistent descriptions of how fuel consumption and\\nhydrocarbon emission depend on traffic conditions. The general finding\\nwas that urban traffic conditions may be quantified by a single charac-\\nteristic--the average speed of the traffic. In this case the study indi-\\ncates that HC emissions may be modelled as a simple function of trip   \\n3.2\\n2.8\\n2.4\\n4 2,0\\n9NZ0 1.6\\nN\\nG\\ny 1.3\\n0.8\\n0.4\\n0\\nODOMETER READING (MILES X 103)\\nFig. B-17.

It is important\\nto note that in this study no simple analytic models were found for CO\\nand NOx.\\nConsidering this latter conclusion, there is stall a need\\nfor a way to estimate consistency of various measurements and its influ-\\nences on mobile sources emissions forecasts and transportation strategies.\\nIn the study of emissions, all 12 cars were equipped with\\ncatalytic converters and emissions both before (engine-out) and after\\n(tailpipe) were studied. Because exhaust emissions do not depend simply\\non, for example, vehicle mass, as is approximately so for fuel consump-\\ntion, a relative relationship between exhaust emission and trafflr\\ncharacteristics was analytically correlated for HC only. An important\\nnote of this study was that engine-out hydrocarbons, being larger and\\nnot subject to additional statistical variability associated with\\npassing through the catalyst, yielded more consistent car-to-car\\nrelations than the tailpipe, emissions (Ref. B-9). Fig. B-18 shows the\\nresults of relating engine-out HC to average trip time per unit dis-\\ntance t, based on the 12 cars run on the FTP (see Ref. B-9 for details),\\nThis relationship indicates that the variable t explained more than half\\nof the variance in HC for 11 of the 12 cars and the average variance\\nexplained by t was more than 70% for these 11 cars.\\nThe intent of this examination of a single variable is to\\ncompare it with the more complex equations derived by EPA, which also\\nindicate the variability with this single variable. This feature is\\nalso described in Ref. B-9 and illustrated by Fig. B-19. In this figure\\nthe ratio of HC emissions at different speeds is shown for the 11 cars\\nwith the 70/ correlation. It also shows EPA data that was used to\\nderive the ratios used in EPA Document AP-42 (Ref. B-10) to derive\\naverage speed exhaust emissions. In the updated version of AP-42, the\\ndraft of Mobile Source Emission Factors (Ref. B-6), Fomposite exhaust\\nemission factors are specified to be calculated per p,;llutant and\\nmodel year. The equation may be evaluated for average speed, ambient\\ntemperature, humidity, fraction of cold operation and fraction of hot\\nstart. It includes the fraction of annual travel and special Load\\nconditions (such as air conditioning and trailer towing). The varia-\\nbility in the single variable, average trip time per unit distance\\npreviously discussed and demonstrated in Figs. B-18 and B-19, may be\\nindicative of the magnitude of variabilities introduced in the other\\nvariables cited. Taken as a composite set of variables and the use of\\naverages per model, year, etc., this averaging might compensate for\\nuncertainty about the average, but the potential for error in projecting\\nshould be ,specified so that as the data base becomes more certain the\\nconfidence in projections increases.\\nAs of now he uncertainty on the average emission factors\\nmay be as ^^tuch as the factors of 2 to 3 that are seen on the variables\\nin the data,;, base. The question is that since the uncertainties are ,.\\nbeing narroo^d as more test data becomes available and as the better\\nemission conezol technologies are applied, will ttie averages adequately +\\npredict the fu4Tre emissions or overpredict i*_?

In addition, the behavior of motor vehicles\\nin ambient temperature depends upon design and type of emission control\\nsystem. Because of the dominanceof the new control technology in late\\nmodel cars and the fact that well over 80% (Ref. B-11) of the cars in\\nthe U.S. have emission control devices and approximately u75% of the\\n>1975 models have catalytic converters (100% in California since 1975),\\nB-21\\n0, kRVh\\n50\\t 90\\t 20\\t 15\\t 10\\t 9\\n0\\n0\\t 100\\t 200\\t 900\\t 400\\t 500\\nAVO, - TRIP TIME PER UNIT DISTANCE, 1, s/km\\nFig. B-19. liyuracarbon Emissions versus Average Trip\\nTime per Unit Distance\\na\\nthe effect of temperature on catalytic converter cars is discussed\\nto highlight- Its importance to transportation planning strategies and\\nits influence on emissions forecast based on test data,\\nIn Ref.

For comparison purposes and to demonstrate the range of\\nthe effect of ambient temperature, California cars are compared with\\nU.S. 49 states cars (all U.S. manufactured) in Fig. B-20a, ,b, c. The\\ncars compared are from 1975 model year with exhaust gas recirculation,\\nmanifold air injection and oxidizing catalytic converters. Particular\\nnot(, was made of the catalytic cars with air Injection because of the\\nsignificantly lower level in emis qions compared with those without air\\ninjection. This was explained by the lack:of oxygen to oxidize the CO\\nand HC present under rich choke conditions. The point made was that the\\nneeded oxygen during cold start would maximize the efficiency of an\\noxidizing catalyst, and air injection would generally be beneficial for\\ninternal combustion engines to achieve the most efficient emission\\ncontrol at lower temperatures. The design of emission control systems\\nfor new cars since 1975 has predominantly included air injection or\\nair pumps.\\nA reasonable comparison for California is that at 00C\\n(320F), a common early morning winter temperature for several months\\nthroughout the year, the HC: and CO emission were about 50% higher during\\nthe cold start phase while the ambient effect was negligible for the\\nother test phases.\\nTherefore, ( ,old ambient temperatures below -IOOC would\\nconsiderably increase the HC and CO emissions but not the NOX during\\nthe cold start phase. This effect of temperature is pronounced in car-,\\nwithout air injection. After warmup the ambient temperature shows a\\nlarge effect. The largest effect of ambient temperature  on CO emissions\\nis shown in Fig. B-21 for the cold transient phase. Fig. B-22 also\\ndemonstrates the effect of amblent temperature during each test phase\\nof the FTI I 1975 and I\\t C )ighway driving.

This indi-\\ncates that the shortest soak period allowable by the FTP would yield\\nthe lowest emission rates in most cases.`P\\nThe behavior in the transient portion of the cycle is con\\nsidered qualitatively identical to the composite cycle results. The HC\\nemission rates were essentially constant in this portion of the cycle\\nregardless of soak } period length The important results are that the\\nbehavior during the transient phase of the cycle is qualitatively\\nidentical to the composite of the transient and stabilized phases.\\nThis means that the characteristic behavior, vs soak time occurred\\nB-25\\n_\\n100\\n0.120°F MODIFIED 1976 FTE AND\\nNWFLT DRIVING SCHEDULE\\nDESIGNATIONTIME INTERVAL,\\nMINUTESCUMULATIVE\\nDISTANCE, MILES\\n---^ 45°F\\nCOLD TRANSIENT..... 1.

However, the\\nNOX emission is typically minimum during idle compared with that at\\nspeeds above 20 mph.\\n\\'the important point from Fig. B-24 is that the idle HC emis-\\nsia;qs may be a significant contribution to the total HC emission. For\\nmany of the older cars, 1974 and earlier, the emission factors are sig-\\nnificantly larger than those for 1975 and new model cars. Again, it is\\nworth noting that 74% of the HC emitted comes from cars that have\\ngreater than 50,000 miles but that these cars only cover 57% of the\\nvehicle miles traveled (Ref.

In addition, the rates and\\nprofile of HC emission vary significantly with fuel, driving patterns,\\nambient conditions and types of emissions control systems used on the\\nvehicle. Currently used control technologies include:\\n(1)Crankcase emissions: positive crankcase ventilation\\ntechnologies.\\n(2)Tailpipe emissions: catalytic converters technologies.\\n(3)Evaporation emissions: absorption--regenerative\\ncarbon canister.\\nEven though the catalytic converters reduce both the mass of HC and\\nthe photochemical reactivity of the HC mixture, the impact of evapora-\\ntive control devices on HC emission has been demonstrated.\\nThe venting of fuel vapors from the carburetor front cham-\\nber and vehicle fuel tank can constitute a sizable source of HC emis-\\nsions in the absence of appropriately functioning control devices. Two\\ntypes of evaporated losc;es are measured: Losses occurring over a 1-hr\\nperiod while fuel (in the vehicle tank) was raised in temperature\\naccording to a prescribed schedule are termed diurnal soak losses.\\nLosses occurring during a 1-hr period while the vehicle cools following\\nthe completion of a complete cold start 1975 FTP are termed hot soak\\n1\\t\\nlosses. The measurement of emissions is made while the vehicles are\\nenclosed in the Sealed Housing for Evaporative Determinations (SIZED).\\nSummary results from the SHED tests are presented in Table\\nB-1. A determination of the mean evaporative losses was made for 20\\n1976-model-year cars in both Denver and Los Angeles. Also included are\\nthe mean and standard deviations for combined losses, which are the\\nresults of calculations from each vehicle that are intended to repre-\\nsent the total Average loss for a vehicle in a ,,day. All three mean\\nlosses are significantly higher for Denver \\'than for Los Angeles, as\\nwould be expected due to the altitude difference.\\nFor some mode!j years the evaporative HC emission may be\\nnearly 1/2 the total mass of HC emitted from the vehicle during its\\nuse. To make this comparison, the Federal test procedure (Ref. B--14)\\ngives an equation that converts evaporative emission (gram/test) to\\ngram/mile using diurnal and hot soak mass emission factors (Ref. B-6)\\nfor these evaporation tests.. The diurnal test simulates emissions\\nexperienced during fuel system Meat build resulting from daily night\\nto afternoon ambient temperature increases. The hot soak`test simulates\\nemissions ex.perfenced on parking the car after an urban driving period.\\n^^-30\\nfr\\t ,\\\\1\\nIn a recent 4-car test series (Ref. 2-2) using a 1963\\nChevrolet, a 1977 Mustang, a 1978 Monarch, and a 1979 LTD-II to per-\\nform a comparative study of evaporative and tailpipe emissions, the\\n1963 and 1977 car data suggested about 50% of the aggregate emission\\nare evaporative. The 1978 and 1979 cars had 35 and 39% of their aggre-\\ngate HC emissions from evaporation sources. These test results indicate\\nthat significant further reduction is necessary to get down to about\\n27% of the total aggregate HC emi^§sions from evaporative sources. This\\n;could be equivalent to achieving the 2.0 g/ test regulation set for\\n1982 cars. For the current average car the level will not significantly\\nchange from the 35 to 50% level until 4-5 years after 1982, as shown\\nin Fig. B-26. This estimate indicates that the HC evaporative emissions\\nlevel per the regulations could be within that allowed by 1987.\\nHowever, satisfying the regulation of 6 g/teat and eventu-\\nally 2 g/test in 1982 is not simply a matter of determining what the\\naverage car does. The important question is how significant and large\\nare the variations among all cars, and does this sensitivity to the\\nemission control configuration, fuel composition, and fuel vapor\\npressure preclude a prediction?\\nAn example of the uncertainty in the data and the large\\nvariation depending on type of emission is shown in Fig. B-27. This\\nfigure shows,the HC evaporative emissions in gm/s5hed test vs car\\nmileage for diurnal, hot carburetor, and total evaporative emissions.\\nThe data points indicate the variability. The solid line on the diurnal\\ncurve displays the trend as a function, of car mileage. In addition,\\ndata from the 1976 Los Angeles 20-car \\'sample gives one estimate of\\ndiurnal emissid[i in L.A. Note the large difference between the two mean\\ndiurnal curves. This is indicative of lack of correlation, large uncer-\\ntainty in the sample, differences in cars and model. years and differ-\\nences in areas where the evaporation take\\'s place.\\nTable B-1.

These\\nprojects include short term projects such as controlling traffic lights\\nor long term projects such as building new highways. Long range projects\\nare primari.;.y concerned with building new transportation facilities,\\nwhereas short term projects, also referred to as \"transportation liystem\\nmanagement,\" are more concerned with achieving more efficient use of\\ncurrent transportation facilities. The outputs of the travel demand\\nforecasting are primarily the forecasts of traffic volume and trae ►sit\\nusage over the primary transportation network. Traffic volumes are\\ngenerally measured in terms of Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT).\\nForecasts of hourly traffic have been performed for many regions,\\nincluding Denver and Los Angeles.\\n1\\nO\\n0 TOTAL EVAPORATIVE EMISSION\\n0 HOT CARBURETOR\\n• DIURNAL\\n1976 LA CARS (20 CAR SAMPLE)\\nMEAN DIURNAL O\\nO\\t O\\n0\\tO\\nQ\\nOO\\t •\\n0\\n•\\n0\\t5000\\t10000\\t15000\\t20000\\t25000\\t30000\\t35000\\t40000 45000\\nMILEAGE, ml\\nFig. B-27.

These temporal patterns, which\\n-ire usuall y assumed to be same for each highway link, are combined with\\nAADT t,^ yield hourly traffic predictions over the traffic network.\\nUrban travel demand forecasting has been used recently to\\ncoordinate transportation planning and air quality management. Trans-\\nportation strategies for improving air quality have been divided into\\ntwo areas: Vehicle emissions control and strategies relating to the\\nusage of the automobile. These latter strategies relate to either\\nreducing the usage of the automobiles or making more efficient use of\\nthe current transportation structure. Strategies aimed at reduced\\nautomobile usage include approaches such as transit improvements, car-\\npool programs, and 4-day work week. Stratec;ies relating to making more\\nefficient usage of the current highway system include light synchroniza-\\ntion, staggered work hours, widened freeways, and systems, reversing\\nlanes, speed limit controls, ramp metering for freeways, and systems\\nfor handling emergencies more efficiently. The travel demand fore-\\ncasting process requires the inputs indicated in Fig. 2-40. These will\\nbe described in the following sections.12\\niG\\n0W\\nx8\\nNzO 6\\nM\\nt-\\n4\\nx 2\\nB-33\\nB.4.1\\tUrban Activity\\nUrban activity is the forcing function behind trips to work,\\nschool, shopping, etc. The , transit and highway networks shown in Fig.\\nB-28 define the paths along which trips are constrained. In order to\\nconveniently describe urban activities and the transportation networks,\\nsimplifications are introduced. First, the urban area is broken into\\n\"zones.\" These zones tend to coincide with standard census zones, which\\ncorrespond to a population unit of about 5000. The physical size of\\nzones tend to become smaller its population becomes more dense.\\nFor example, Zonal Urban Activity Forecasts-depend upon\\nparameters as (Ref. B-15, p. 1-24):\\n(1)Total urban area population and employment estimates.\\n(2)Location and behavior of people and businesses.\\n(3)Local policies regarding land development, transpor-\\ntation, zoning, sewers, etc.\\nThe purpose of urban travel demand forecasting is to relate travel\\nactivities to forecasts of zonal urban activities. For each zone,, spe-\\ncific information must be collected. For example, for the LARTS\\nsystem (Los Angeles Regional Transportation Study), the following zonal\\nfactors are collected (Ref. B-16):\\ni\\nFig. B-28. The Environment of Travel Demand Forecasting\\n(Ref.

The transit and highway networks are described analyti-\\ncally to help predict travel patterns along major arterieo. In some\\ncases, minor acteri^s are included in an analysis. Collector street\\ntraffic is usually not predicted directly. These networks are specified\\nin terms of highway links. Each 1lok contains two nodes, which repre-\\nsent Intersections of various highway or transit links. uLbec proper-\\nties of these networks such as the level of service and the capacity\\nmuy be used in determining the paths chosen between u specific origin\\nand destination. Capacity in determined by the type of facility, speed\\nlimit \\' and the number of laoee. Leval of service is related to the\\neffective speed, xd`icb is also determined by the amount of congestion.\\nOther purmmeters vd,1ch can influence both the mode of transportation\\nand the cost include parking availability and costs.\\nD.4.2 \\t Travel Demand Forecasting \\t^\\nIn order to simplify thecepLoul process, one assumes\\nthat all traffic in a zone begins uu \\t do at a single node, which is\\nthe reotroid or \"center of maun°` of the population. This ceutroid is^connected to tbo transportation network 6v u Firt(0001 network link,\\nreferred to as a ^eeotn,ld connector.\"\\n-\\' Driving patterns of people are determined by Ori8io-Deati-\\nwntino^(0-D) surveys, which are sampled no a house-t \\tmuae hoaia to\\ndetermine the following typical information (Ref. 13-15, p ^ 3-15):\\nFor each house:\\n\\'\\t (l)\\tAdd cene.\\n(2)\\tNumber of persons. \\'\\n(2)\\tNumber of cars avuilahle.`\\n(4)\\t` Occupation.\\nD_35 ^\\n3\\nFFor each trip;\\n(1)Who took trip.\\n(2)When trip began and ended. \\tj\\n(3)Times of beginning and end.\\n(4)Purpose at origin.\\n(5)Purpose at destination.\\n(6)Mode of transportation.\\n(7)Type of activity at origin and destination.\\nTo determine patterns for trips that originate outside the\\nplanning region, roadway surveys are taken. Additional information that\\nis used to develop models are truck and taxi surveys, counts of vehicle\\ntraffic and transit ridership. By comparing Figs. B-28 and B-29 it may\\nbe seen that urban travel demand forecasting involves the following\\nfour steps: l\\',\\n(1)Trip generation: Forecast number of trips to be\\nmade (trip ends).\\n(2)Trip dis.vribution: Where trips go.(connect ends).\\nA\\n(3)Mode usage: How trips will be taken by each mode of\\ntravel (car, transit).t;\\n(4)Trip assignment: Predicts routes trips will take,\\nresulting in traffic forecasting for highway system\\nand ridership forecasts for transit system.\\nx.\\nThese four steps are separately described in the following sections. \\t a\\nB.4.2.1\\tTripGeneration. Trip generation is the process by which\\ntrip ends are predicted for. each zone. Each trip has two ends: \\'a pro-\\nduction end and an attraction end. All trips that begin or end at home\\nare produced at home and attracted by the other end. Other types of\\ntrips are produced at the origin and are attracted by the destination.\\nFor the purpose of trip generation it is useful to separate out trips.\\ninto different trip types, as classified by trip ends. For example,\\nLAR S employs 5 different trip types (lief. \\tB-16, p. \\t5).\\nR\\ni\\nB-36\\n-7--\\n\\\\/\\n^\\n^\\n),\\n>\\n`\\t Fig. 8-29, Structure of tbc- \\'Ur6au Demand Pore,ontiu^,^\\t(De[.

Several techniques such as multiple linear regres-\\nsion and cross classification are used to develop these models. Only\\nthe cross classification technique will be discussed. For example, trips\\ngenerated at a household may be predicted on the basis of automobile\\navailability and household income. Concerning household availability,\\nhouseholds are divided into three categories: 0 cars, 1 car, 2+ cars.\\nLARTS predic\"ts the number of trips based on automobile availability,\\nwhich is a function of type of housing unit, population per unit, ratio\\nof single housing units to total units, median income, and country.\\nSeparate models are used to distribute total trips among the different\\ntrip types. Trips are attracted to various locations depending on the\\ncharacter, the location, and the activities taking place there. Work-\\nrelated attractions are related to the number of employees. Shopping-\\nrelated attractions are a function of shop square footage.\\nB. 4.2.2\\tTrip Distribution. Since trip distribution is the process\\nof matching trip ends, the output of this process is a trip table that\\nrelates trip production to trip attractions on a zone-by-zone basis.\\nThe most common methods employed for trip generation include the FRATAR\\nmethod, the intervening opportunity method, and the gravity method. Only\\nthe last method will be discussed in this report.\\nThe gravity model (Ref. B-15, p. 4-3) is summarized by the\\nfollowing equation.\\nA\\nT..=ij\\tn\\nA.F(t)i.j\\nwhere:\\nTij = total number of trips produced in zone i and\\nattracted to zone j\\nPi = trips produced in zone i\\nAj = trips attracted to zone j\\nF(t)ij = friction factors\\nr\\nB-3\\nINITIAL FRICTION FACTORS\\nTRAVELTIME TABLES AND TRIP TABLES\\na,\\n_ t \\t `\\nAPPLY MODEL AND DISTRIBUTE TRIPS\\nADJUST\\nATTRACTION\\nFACTORS\\nADJUST \\t NOT BALANCEDFRICTION \\t COMPARE ATTRACTIONS\\nFACTORS \\t I\\nI- \\t BALANCED?\\nUNSATISFACIUKY \\tCOMPARE TRIP TIME DISTRIBUTION\\nAND AVERAGE TRIP TIME\\nGOOD COMPARISON?\\ni\\nCALIBRATION FRICTION FACTORS\\nFig. B-30. Calibration of the Gravity Model\\n(Ref. 1315, p. 4-23)\\nThe friction factor F ij measures the tendency of people to\\nwant to travel from zone i to zone 7. If the friction factor. Fij is\\nlarge, than the prolsensity to travel. from I to j is larger. Thus,\\n\"friction\" factor is somewhat sI misnomer. A better term would be\\n\"attraction factor.\" Friction factors arr chosen to reflect the\\nobserved fact that people tend to prefer to minimize travel required\\nto accomplish a given objective. Thus, people \\'tend to go to shopping\\ncenters nearer their home, than to ones farther away. In some analyses\\nFij is hypothesized to be inversely proportional to the travel time\\nbetween zone i and zone j. Socioeconomic factors may also be used to\\ncause predicted travel patterns to better agree with survey dataa.\\nB-39\\n^I\\nIn order to make the gravity model work, it is necessary to\\ncalibrate the model; i.e., determine the friction factors. In particu-\\nlar, although the gravity model automatically generates the appropriate\\nnumber of attraction per zone, it does not necessarily generate the\\nappropriate number of attractions (Ref. B-15, p. 4-22). Thus the process\\nrequires adjustment of the attractions to balance the process. Friction\\nfactors and socioeconomic factors must be empirically determined.\\nThree items are used as input for the calibration process.\\n(1)Production-attraction tables for each trip purpose.\\n(2)Travel time (impedance) for all zone pairs.\\n(3)Initial friction factors.\\nFig. B-30 summarizes the process for calibrating the gravity model.\\n \\'I\\nB.4.2.3\\tMode. Usage. Mode usage models simulate personal travel\\nchoices involving alternative modes such as car, car pool, and public\\ntransportation. Factors that influence mode usage are (Ref. B-15,\\nP. 5-3):\\n(1)Characteristics of tripmaker.\\n(2)Characteristics of the trip.\\n(3)Characteristics of the transportation system.\\nSome of the most important characteristics of the tripmaker that affect\\nmode usage are (Ref. B-15, p. 5-3):\\n(1)Family income.\\n(2)Number of automobiles available.\\n(3)Education level. \\t\\nl\\n(4)Family size.\\n(5)Family\\'s .age distribution.\\n(6)Type of dwelling.\\n(7)Residential density.\\n(8)Distance from tripmaker\\'s dwelling to the central\\nbusiness district.\\nCharacteristics that affect the choice of mode are trip type, trip\\ndistance, time of day, travel time and Ctost.\\nB-40\\nThe mode usage model used by LARTS calculates a demand\\'\\nfunction only for home-work trips, which account for 45% of the trips\\nreported in the 1967 home interviews. The survey showed that for every\\nhome-work transit trip, there was .09 other-work and 1.10 non-work\\ntransit trip. These factors are used to calculate these other trips\\nbased upon the home-work trips. The estimate of the home-work transit\\ntrips is based upon a two-step process:\\n(1)First, a marginal disutility function is calculated\\nthat presents the difference in \"time\" between use\\nof the transit system and the automobile.\\n(2)The demand is calculated based upon empirical curves\\nthat relate demand to the disutility and the level\\nof household income.\\nTho marginal disutility function is as follows (Ref. B-16,\\nP. 22):\\nT -A\\nU = (T -A2.5 (TX\\' xA) +r r\\t.25 I\\nwhere\\nU = the marginal disutility\\nTr = transit running time\\nA  = automobile running time\\nTx = transit excess (access and waiting) time\\nAx = auto excess (access and terminal) time\\nT = transit costc\\nAo = perceived auto operation cost (include parking fee)\\nI = zonal median income\\nIn this equation, excess time is seen to weigh a factor of 2.5 more\\nthan running time. The cost of time is calculak.ad  by dividing the costs\\nby the tripmaker\\'s perceived value of time, which has been shown to vary\\ninversely with one quarter of his income.\\ni\\nFor auto traffic, the mode use model must also specify the\\nnumber of vehicle trips, which will be generally less than the person\\ntrips as more than one person can occupy a car. The factor that con-\\nverts automobile trips to person trips is the \"automobile occupancy\\nfactor.\" LARTS models this parameter as a function of trip distance.\\nB-41\\nY\\n4\\nP\\t 1\\nB.4.2.4\\tAssignment/,\\' The object of the assignment phase is to deter-\\nmine which paths are dhosen for the trips by both automobile and transit\\nmodes. In order to simplify the assignment process, all trips beginning\\nor ending a zone end at a fictional point, \"centroid,\" which corresponds\\nto the center of mass of population. The centroid is connected to the\\nnetwork by a set of \"centroid\" connectors. Centroid connectors are\\nartificial components of the network that: represent all streets which\\nare not specifically defined on the network.\\nSeveral techniques are available in determining the assign-\\nment of highway trips. One common approach (Ref. 2-21) begins by finding\\nthe path with the minimum impedance, measured in terms of cost, total\\ntime, or a combination of factors. The process of developing the\\nminimum impedance paths between nodes is referred to as \"path finding.\"\\nThe total process of developing the set of optimized paths is referred\\nto as \"path skimming.\"\\nThe above process may lead to an unreasonable assignment of\\ntraffic volume on specific links (Ref. B-15, p. 6-16).

They include: Solar wind power impinging on the dayside magnetopause approximately 1.4 10 to the 13th power watt; power input to cross tail current approximately 3 10 to the 11th power watt; energy of moderate magnetic storm approximately 2 10 to the 15th power joule; power related to the flow of j approximately 1 to 3 10 to the 11th power watt; average power deposited by the aurora approximately 2 10 to the 10th power watt. Stored magnetic energy: released in a substorm approximately 1.5 10 to the 14th power joule. Compared to the above, the rate at which energy is released locally in magnetospheric regions where magnetic merging occurs is probably small. Merging is essential, however, for the existence of open field lines, which provide the most likely explanation for some major energy inputs listed here. Merging is also required if part of the open flux of the tail lobes is converted into closed flux, as seems to happen during substorms. Again, most of the energy release becomes evident only beyond the merging region, though some particles may gain appreciable energy in that region itself, if the plasma sheet is completely squeezed out and the high latitude lobes interact directly.\", 'Stern, D.

And, just as\\nis the case with finances, any discrepancy uncovered by such an\\naudit constitutes a strong hint of deeper trouble.\\nI would like to conduct here a very quick audit of this sort\\nand derive or cite in the next half hour some fundamental Energy\\nand power levels associated with the magnetosphere.\\n(\\tS 1 i d e \\t1\\t)\\nThe first quantity is P 1, the power conveyed by a beam of the\\nsolar wind with the same cross-seetion as the dayside magneto-\\nsphere, say 30 R E. It is generally agreed that the solar wind is\\nthe energy source of the magnetosphere, and P 1 therefore provides\\na sort of an upper limit to what can be extracted from it -- it\\nis the power obtained if all solar wind particles hitting the\\ndayside magnetopause gave up their entire energy.\\nTake a cross section of about ;. \\';1 16 m2, density 10 per cc and\\nSpeed 300 km/sec (there\\'s more speed but less density ahead of\\n5014\\'r to^stant\\n3-10 watt /-m1m5 olotr Wind Evier9y W.tt►n9 8a3si4e Mov e opaust\\nN v 300 si\\t\\ni5 RE\\n10 cwi 3\\t\\nA--3 10Y\\'\\n?I = -n v W A\\n1p, N 1.4 1 0 13  \\nMatt\\n5unsl+;na 6ittin3 Eaftli\\nFigure 1?:,- , 1.15 10 Ill \\nWatt\\nII\\n- 2 -\\nthe bow shook) and you get about\\nP1 = 1.4 10 13 watt\\n1% of this energy is 1.4 1011 watt, and that is the widely\\ncited order of magnitude of the energy extracted.\\nIt is ir.:,eresting to compare this figure to the solar energy\\ninput rate P 2 impinging on the Earth. The area available is about\\n700 times less -- just the cross section of the Earth -- but the\\nenergy flux, the so-called solar constant, is big, 1370 watt/m2.\\nFrom this\\nP,, = 1.75 10 17 watt\\nThis is over 10,000 times P 1 and over a million times the\\ncanonical v.Aer of energy input into the magnetosphere. It\\'s this\\nhuge factor that makes it so difficult to devise a significant\\nsun-weather coupling not involving sunlight.\\n( S\\ti d e\\t2)\\nWell, what are the magnetospheric processes that require\\nenergy? One prime candidate is the cross tail current. If we take\\n15Y as the lobe field, the surface current density corresponding\\nto the plasma sheet is eB/u 0, which comes to about 3 10 5 ampere\\nper RE of tail length. Taking a length of 20 R E then gives\\n6 106 amperes, and if the cross-tail voltage is 50,000 volt, we\\nneed a power input\\nP3 = 3 10 11 watt\\nor about 2% of P1.\\nNow this is one of .he biggest item 4t in our I.udget, and it is\\nsubject to a great deal of uncertainty, Why 50,000 volts? Because\\nthat is the voltage observed across the polar cap in an open\\nmagnetosphere, and if the lobes represent open flux, there is no\\nway for the tail current to close without jumping a gap of 50,000\\nEnex y Im t to Cross-tail CurrP.n\\'C\\nP^ = 3 • 10 Watt\\nIf Ma\\nt ctosphtrt is closed P. = o\\nlior\\n.r, volts \\t50,000 v\\nCl o std \\t Orb\\nF 4ure 2\\n- 3 -\\nvolts or so, as the slide should make clear.\\n(And by the way, if the magnetosphere is closed, and inter-\\nplanetary field lines are equipotentials, you get no voltage and\\nno P3, as the slide also shows.)\\nIn fact, you can devise a reasonable dynamo mechanism by which\\nthis voltage is transmitted to the current, and if your imagi-\\nnation is good, you can even regard the boundary layer as \"spent\\nsolar wind\" which has given up most of its energy, something like\\nthe relatively slow stream of water that comes out from the exit\\nof a turbine wheel.\\nWhy 3 10 5 amperes per R E? We get this number from AB, and it\\nmay be argued that it would be more proper to use AH, i.e. omit\\ncontributions by the magnetization current, in the same way as\\none would do in the presence of ordinary diamagnetic materials.\\nIt turns out that magnetization currents do require energy. It is\\na tricky question, but I lack the time to discuss it.\\nWhy 20 R E? Why not 200? Of course, the voltage and the lobe\\nfield intensity may drop off somewhat, but one car still make an\\nestimate of the total tail length and of the associated power\\nrequirement. It turns out that the length indeed reaches several\\nhundred R E, and the power level is 2-3 10 12 watt, i.e. 7-10 times\\nlarger than P 3. This is the figure cited by Siscoe and others.\\n( S 1 1 0 e \\t3)\\nI tend to be s,-)mewhat suspicious of this figure, though it\\'s\\nmore a gut feeling than solid Pvidence. Most of this energy is\\ndeposited past the orbit -)f the moon, yet the Rice instrument\\nleft on the moon has suggested that the plasma sheet may be\\napproaching its end there.\\nFurthermore, the energy flowing into the inner magnetosphere\\nis far smaller. Consider the inner edge of the plasma sheet--say,\\n40 RE wide by 5 R E thick, 0.5 particles /cc at 5 keV each, that is\\nbeing generous. A drop of 50,000 volt at B = 5Y gives a drift\\nvelocity of 40 km /sec, and a power input\\ne^\\n1\\nV %A\\nIn\\nL\\t O \\'n\\nd <_N 1: \\tF3 \\tNa\\n4,\\ta W\\n-4J\\tQ I\\t ^!\\na J^0\\t¢,\\n(L ¢\\t `13d QCC\\nX o—\\t 3d\\t a\\nT\\tS T0 \\t\\\\\\nN\\nz ^v\\n3e\\ncq\\tO\\n0 CO\\n2\\nCOO or\\nm\\naV444\\n- 4 -\\nP4 a 1.28 10 11 watt\\nOf course, the tail can store some every in its magnetic field\\nand release it later in substorms, but I doubt you could get an\\naveragerage power input above 3 10 11 watt even with this.\\nSo if indeed the energy input into the tail is 20 times Pu, I\\nsuspect that almost all of it is returned to the solar wind by\\nspilling out of the flanks or in other ways, and the final result\\nis ,+,ust some heating of the Earth\\'s wake.\\n( S l i d a \\t4)\\nNext, what is the energy -- call it W 5 -- that is stored in\\nthe ring current. in the inner magnetosphere?\\nYou probably all know that the effect of the ring current is\\nto decrease B at the Earth, and that this decrease is charac-\\nteristic of magnetic storms, amounting to up to hundreds of Y.\\nNow there exists a remarkable formula due to Dessler, Parker and\\nScko ke, which says that with certain assumptions, if the ring\\ncurrent causes at the origin a decrease eB, then\\nW5 = 1.5 (AB/Be) Ue\\nwhere B e is the surface equatorial field intensity and\\nUe = B2 R3 /3 s 8.4 1017 ,joule\\nis the magnetic energy of the main field contained within the\\nEarth. So\\nif\\tAB = 100 y \\tthen\\tW5 = 4 10 15 joule\\nTwo things must be noted. One. the formula assumes a certain\\nmodel for the ring current: for realistic models, the formula may\\nno longer be accurate.

The\\nrecent MAGSAT field analysis based on two very quiet days\\nrequired an external term, corresponding to a baseline value of\\nAB of 201x. If we take this seriously we see that even at very\\nquiet times the ring current contains some 10 15 joule.\\n( S l i d e \\t5)\\nSuppose now that you have a magnetic storm of AB z 100Y and\\nthat W5 is really only 1/2 of what the formula gives. Then\\nW5 ,r 2 1015 joule\\nLet the energy input from the tail be\\nptail\\t4 1011 watt\\nSo we n eed\\n5000 sec o 1.5 hours\\nto build up the magnetic storm. Compare this to the slide, taken\\nfrom a recent article (Sugiura, EOS. October 1980) , where D st may\\nbe regarded as the same as AB. On the time axis below it each\\ntick mark is 1 day and the whole graph extends over a week:as you\\nsee, the magnetic storm indeed builds up gradually, and perhaps\\nyou appreciate now the reason why.\\nOne must be careful with these numbers. If a quiet-time\\nequilibrium exists, then trapped orbits and non-trapped ones\\ndon\\'t mix, and those 10 11 watt convected from the quiet-time\\ntail flow by the ring current without adding to it. It is the\\nprime feature of magnetic storms that this separation is broken\\ndown -- by transient electric fields from powerf!

Again certain cautions must be\\nnoted -- in a big magnetic storm much of the effect may be due to\\na tem orarry growth of a particle population of which only a part\\nmay be trapped, or as the term goes, in a \"partial ring current.\"\\nBut we ignore this now and assume that the Dessler-Parker-Sckopke\\nrelation is valid. Dining very disturbed times it was then found\\nby Kamide and Fukushima in 1971 (Rep. lonosph. Space Res. Japan,\\n25, 125, 1971) that\\nP6 = 2 10 11 - 2 10 12 watt\\t(AE ,, 1000 r)\\nThat\\'s rather big, but these are values for very disturbed\\ntimes. Neil Davis (JGR Y4, :,266, 1969) estimated the annual\\naverse of P6 and got a much smaller value\\n< P6 > =1.2 — 1.7 10 10 watt\\nI should add that both these articles used the Dessler—Parker\\nScbkopke relation without any discounts, so maybe a further\\ndivision by 2 is warranted, here and in what follows.\\nNow it must also be assumed that any energy added to the ring\\ncurrent system at t-0 gradually dissipates again -- if this\\nprovision is not made, then W 5 has no way to go but up. Kamide\\nand Fukushima found that an exponential time constant of 40 hours\\nfit the data quite well, and - i s may or may noc be related to\\nloss by charge exchange with neutral \\'iydrogen (Smith et al, JGR\\n81, 2701, 1976).\\nThe interesting thing is that when this decay is taken into\\nI r!\\n\\'ic.aj tA ^1C Storm\\ndie) 0 too r\\nWs Ov Z. %e 6\"It\\npb y • o\" Watt\\n\"C 500 0 5\"\\t 61ACSk-not from tail\\nSince.

Spac e Sci , 28, 495, 1980; top\\ncol. 2, P. 501) puts\\nP6 = Min y).10 9 watt\\nwhich is inside the range given by Kamide and Fukushima, and he\\nthan compares this to his proposed solar wind-magnetosphere\\ncoupling index e, which has similar values. It is this fact that\\nP6 seems to be proportional to AE which suggests that a magnetic\\nstorm is pumped u p by a series of substorms, and that each\\nsubstorm is one stroke of the pump that inflates the magneto-\\nsphere. However, there exist those who disagree, or who claim\\nthat this is part of the story but not the entire story of\\nmagnetic storms.\\n( S l i d e \\t7)\\nNext input: how much energy goes into the Birkeland currents?\\nLet us count only the poleward \"region 1\" currents, because\\npresumably the second (and weaker) system of currents located\\nfurther equatorward is drained by then as well.

Part of it closes\\nacross the polar cap, and then 50,000 volts is certainly appro-\\nrid3\\n\"O\\nr,\\n-^\\t nt\\nr\\n^\\tr\\n> H\\ncli\\n11i.4DOsplyQe\\n2.\\nV A\\t:^ JO \\tL\\t\\n^.

The other part cosies from convected charges via the\\nregion 2 sheets, and there the value nay be an overestimate,\\nbecause such particles already have so,iked up some energy during\\ntheir trip earthwards, and we have already counted that energy as\\npart of the input into the cross-tail current.\\nSo the energy input we get this way is really more of an upper\\nlimit. We must further multiply by 2, because the above figures\\nare per polar oap, and this gives\\nP7 s1.4 1011 watt (quiet)\\nP7 s2.7 1011 watt (disturbed)\\nNisbet et al. (JGR 83, 2647, 1978) get 1.2 10 11 watt, but they\\nassume only half as much power in the summer hemisphere as in the\\nwinter hemisphere, because their model fields are weaker. In any\\ncase, all this is ,just an order of magnituee.\\n( S 1 1 d e \\t8 )\\nFinally, let\\'s take the aurora. The only global assessment of\\nauroral energy input was performed by Sharp and Johnson (JGR 73,\\n969, 1968) who used total energy detectors, sensitive down to\\n80 ev. That was 12 or 13 years ago and I hope someone will check\\nit with new data when DE goes up next year.

It\\'s somewhat intricate-looking, so I\\nwould not encourage you to try to assimilate it here -- there\\nexist copies for distribution, which you can study later in more\\ndetail.\\nAs you can see, most energy inputs are pretty much in agree-\\nment with each other. Maybe it\\'s a bit of an anticlimax, because\\nthere has been so far very little mention of the more exotics pro-\\ncesses involved, such as mer inj and substorms (I preft +• \"m^r-\\nging\" to \"reconnection\" because it\\'s 2 syllables shorter, Though\\n\"reconnection\" is always appropriate to describe the re-!)airi-\\ncation of two sections of a field line which has been earlier\\ntorn apart).\\nActually, as has been already noted, merging on the dayside is\\nessential for an open magnetosphere, and unless the configuration\\nis open, there exists no voltage between opposite flanks of the\\ntail.\\nHowever, when people discuss merging, they frequently have in\\nmind additional things be.-,ides change of topology.

What these people have noted (and\\nthis idea can be extended to include details such as shocks etc.)\\nis that since the flow velocity v along the x and y axes is E/B,\\nas B goes to zero v gets rather large.

Let me\\nstress here, the \\te x i s t e n c a of neutral points or lines\\nin the tail does not by itself assure merging, such points or\\nlines can also exist in a stagnant field. What makes it a process\\nof merging is that the plasma is flowing through the neutral\\npoint or line.\\nIf such a flow takes place, then the energy released is\\ngenerally believed to be the magnetic energy of the high-latitude\\ntail lobes. How much is that? Regard the tail lotes as two\\nhalf-cylinders, 20 R E in radius and 50 RE long. This gives\\n20,000 R cubic earth radii, each of them 2.6 10 20 m3: if the lobe\\nfield is 15 Y, we get\\nW10 \\' 1.45 10 15 joule\\n(MI GINAL PAGE IS\\nCIF ppnR QUAD\\n^I\\n^I\\n^.. mom\\nx F -narroo strtar^Bosses +,6r6%\\ntwt to er^1.n ^\\n^r\\nit\\nFigure 10\\nJ\\tt G h er St o^zc^ in -t^ t Tail.1 ^Q h^ LG\\t^^\\nWn r\\'L ^3 /Z\\t^\\' 1.4 5IT\\n jouleto l\\t\\nQ%O \\t\\\\000 sec\\t\\nEO\\t^ . 4 5 10 ,,,,^tt\\nFigure 11\\n- 11 -\\nor about 1/3 of what\\'s in the ring current.\\nCaan at al. (JGR 78, 8087. 1913) have estimated from before\\n-and-after comparisons that s pmething like 10% of the lobe energy\\nIs released in a sub storm , and if this output Is spread over 1000\\nseconds, we get\\nP10 a 1.45 10 11 watt\\nIf the time Scale is faster, you get a \\' W igher level. Even if\\nyou believe that substorms get their energy by some direct\\ncoupling to the solar wind, unless there exists a flaw in Caen\\'s\\nstudy, you must add P 10 to the sum of energies released during a\\nsub storm .\\n( S 1 i d e \\t1 2 )\\nLet me end on a somewhat exotic ns; e. You can see that\\nneutral lines forming inside the plasms sheet are created in\\npairs -- an X-type line and an 0-type line (actually, they are\\nprobably connected in the 3rd dimension) .\\nThe X-type line is the place where field lines pass as they are\\nconvected earthward -- and the plasma on these lines ultimately\\nreceives most of the released energy, as it moves into stronger\\nmagnetic fields near Earth and its particles are adisbaticallf\\nenergized.\\nThe plasma flowing into the 0-type line, however, is\\naccelerated much more efficiently along that line, because that\\nline acts like a sinkhole, sucking in particles from all around\\nit. Once a particle is drawn towards the 0-line, it does not rest\\nuntil it is very close to the axis, where its motion is non-\\nadiabatic and where it is rapidly accelerated by whatever voltage\\nis available.\\nVasyliunas (to be published) has argued that the vc age\\n4\\nN.r\\nd\\nw\\n- 12 -\\navailable her# cannot be too big, and his argument can be\\nrsphrased as follows. What you have here is really a very\\nefficient mechanism for \"annihilation of magnetic fields.\" The\\nI\\t plasma and its magnetic field flow together into the sinkhole and\\nout comes the plasma alone, so the magnetic energy must be given\\nto the particles. How much will each particle get?\\nIt all depends on the beta of the plasma. If beta a 1 — a good\\napproximation for the plasma sheet -- then the average particle\\nenergy can at most double. FWt if during the \"thinning\" that\\naccompanies substorms, the Massa sheet is completely squeezed\\nout and the two high-latit: de lobes merge directly, then beta is\\nabout 1/100 and a hunderdfold energization is quite possible. In\\nother words, there exist so few particles in the lobe plasma,\\nthat if the energy of their surrounding magnetic field is trans-\\nformed to provide them with additional kinetic energy, each of\\nthem receives quite a lot. In the total energy budget this is\\nprobably a small item, but it could account for the high-energy\\nbursts observed in the tail by APL\\'s instruments.\\n( S l i d e \\t1 3 )\\nIn summary, here are somesome of the numbers concerned with\\nthe energy budget of the magnetosphere, and if they do not seem\\nto be unusually surprising, it may be mainly because they are not\\ntoo sensitive to the details of the driving processes. ?here\\nstill exists a lot about these processes that we do not know, and\\nin particular, even at this late stage, I would not at all\\ndiscount the possibility that given all popular theories for\\nexplaining the substorm, the correct answer is still \"none of the\\nabove.\"\\n( e n d )\\nMo.O^^___Osrl\\'ersc Po,asr L4v^1^\\n-\\t,oWaitt\\n^^n1r•t^n^ir^^ so%Ar V11 iv%a 6.hectl\\t\\nR1\\t 1400\\n5\"\"SW nt on €Qr tt%\\tPz \\t 1,150, 000\\nCxoss- -tad r\"tr \\t 10 RE\\tP3 ~ so\\n6RO.) at ;nner eat\\' of Plasn+a S6ttt K\\t 13\\nknit ciuri.n j Mokyctic.

Sincethisis \\nthesimplest configuration forwhich thetheory isvalid, itwasdecided that \\nthepreliminary acoustic testing should becarried outonasingle Y-tube. \\n\"Afullsizesketch ofthemodel isshowninfigure I.Itismadeofglassand \\nisnominally symmetric.

Theanechoic chamber \\nwasprimarily usedtoreduce theinfluence ofexternal ambient acoustic dis- \\nturbances whichwouldotherwise maskthedesired acoustic phenomena. Tests \\nweremadeonlyintheexpiratory modeduetotheadditional complication oftwo \\nmatched soundsources present fortheinspiratory case. Ascanbeseenin \\nfigure 2,a2.54cmmicrophone (frequency response flatoverlO-15,000 Hz)with \\nitscapremoved wasplaced at90°totheaxisoftheparent tubeascloseas O\\npossible (=lcm)tothetubewithout flowimpinging onthemicrophone itself. \\n° Flowwassupplied tothemodel byasystem whichisshownschematically• \\ninfigure 3.Thestandard shopairsupply (pressure 6xlO5Newton/m 2)was \\npassed through aseries oftwocontrol valves inorder toreduce ittothe \\n\\n4\\nsmallpressures andflowratesrequired forthistesting. Theflowthenwent \\nintoaflowmeter tomeasure thevolume flowwhichthengavethetestvelocity \\nthrough knowledge ofthetubearea. Finally, theflowexited intoanacoustic \\nmuffler toremove noisegenerated intheflowreduction sequence. Themuffler \\nactually wasacommercial water filter housing inwhich adualchamber filled \\nwithfiberglass produced verylowbackground noiselevels atallflowratesof \\ninterest inthetests, aswillbeseeninsubsequent spectra. \\nTheflowthenpassed through averylongsupply tube(:7m)intothe \\nanechoic chamber andwassplitbyacommercial Y-tube intothetwoflows \\nrequired bythetest. Thecommercial Y-tube hadallthreebranches ofthe \\nsamediameter, 0.954cm,andthustheflowwasdecelerated uponpassing through \\nthisjunction. Eachflowthenproceeded through acontraction section to \\nreduce ittothediameter, 0.34cm,ofthedaughter branches ofthemodel and \\nthenthrough Tygon tubesofapproximately 0.5minlength before entering the \\nmodel. Noisespectra whichwereobtained ateachjuncture ofthisflowsystem \\nwerebroadband withnounusual features. \\nTests runovertheReynolds number (Re=UoDo/_ whereUoandDOarethe \\nvelocity anddiameter oftheparent tube,respectively, and_isthekinematic \\nviscosity ofair)range50-4500 whereSchroter andSudlow 2observed thevortices \\nwerecompleted. BelowtheReynolds number of965,nothing couldbe.observed \\noverthebackground noiseofthesystem. Ofcourse, thisrangecorresponds to \\nverylowpressures andflowratesinthesystem. Astheflowratewasfurther \\nincreased, intense tonesbeganappearing inthespectrum. These tonesformed a J\\nharmonic series withtheamplitude ofthefundamental atleast20dBabove the \\nbackground leveland15dBabovethelevelofanyharmonic, ofwhich therewere \\n\\n5\\nasmanyasninereadily observed. Atypical spectrum inthisregion isshownin \\nfigure 4.Thisbehavior wasobserved uptoReynolds number of1488where the \\n, tonescompletely disappeared intothebackground level. Overthisrange, the \\nfundamental frequency varied from200to360Hertz. \\nWhentheflowratewasstillfurther increased, nothing interesting was \\nobserved untiltheReynolds number of1787wasreached where anewsetoftones \\nappeared. These tonesweremuchhigher infrequency andagainformed a \\nharmonic series withthefundamental amplitude 30dBabovethebackground level \\nandlOdBabovethehighest harmonic amplitude. Asmanyasfourharmonics were \\nseenintherangeofanalysis. Atypical spectrum inthisregion isshownin \\nfigure 5.Thisbehavior wasobserved uptotheReynolds number of2360where \\nthetonesagaindisappeared intothebroadband flownoise. OverthisReynolds \\nnumber range, thefrequency ofthefundamental varied from1210to1775Hertz. \\nFurther increases inflowrateshowed nofurther interesting behavior, onlya \\ngeneral riseinthebroadband flownoise. Thesephenomena werequite repeat- \\nable,appearing atthesamevelocities regardless ofwhether theflowrate \\nwasbeingraised orlowered andturned onandoffquitesharply withonly \\nsmallchanges invelocity. \\nThisexperiment wasdesigned totestthetheory developed byHardin and \\nPatterson Iforsoundproduction inthehumanlung. Thistheory predicted \\nthat,onexpiration, eachbronchus withflowintheReynolds number range \\n° 50-4500 wouldgenerate soundwithfundamental frequency, fo\\'givenby \\nUoDI_.I)2\" fo=o.212 (I) \\nwhere UoandDoarethepreviously defined velocity anddiameter oftheparent \\n\\n6\\nbronchus respectively andD1isthediameter ofthedaughter bronchi (.assuming \\nsymmetry). Thetheory alsopredicts thatthefirst harmonic ofthisfrequency \\nwillbegenerated aswell. Notethatthetheory shows thefrequency tobe \\ndirectly proportional tothevelocity, i.e.asthevelocity goestozero, the \\nfrequency goestozero. \\nInfigure 6,thistheory iscompared withthedataobtained inthisexperi- \\nment. Thefigure isaplotofthefrequencies atwhich thetones appeared as \\nafunction oftheReynolds number oftheflowinthe parent tube. Thetone \\nfrequencies wereobtained directly fromtheacoustic spectra suchasfigures \\n4and5,andtheReynolds numbers werecalculated fromtheknown velocity and \\ndiameter oftheparent tubeusing thevalue of0.154 cm2/sec forthekinematic \\nviscosity ofair. Notetheappearance ofseveral harmonics asdiscussed earlier. \\nForthepurpose ofthiscomparison, Eq.(1)hasbeenrewritten interms of \\ntheReynolds number as \\nfo=0.212 D-_Re (2) \\nThislinear relation isthesolid linemarked \"Theory\" onfigure 6.Ascanbe \\nseen, thistheory agrees quite wellwiththefundamental frequency ofthe \\nphenomenon observed inthelower Reynolds number range, 965_Re_1488. The \\ntonefrequencies exhibit alinear dependence uponReynolds number whose slope \\nisalmost precisely thatpredicted bythetheory, although thetheory does \\nslightly overpredict thefrequencies themselves. Thisslight overprediction \\nisprobably duetotheupper bound estimate ofthecirculation ofthevortices \\nemployed inreference I. \\nThephenomenon observed inthehigher Reynolds number range, 1787_Re \\n2360, however, appears tobesomething different. Although thefrequencies are \\nstill alinear function oftheReynolds number, theslope ismuchgreater than \\n\\n7\\nthatfoundinthelowerReynolds number range. Further, ifthephenomenon were \\nextrapolated backtolowerReynolds numbers, itisclearfromthefigure that \\n• thefrequency wouldgotozeroatafinite Reynolds number rather thanzeroas \\ntheotherphenomenon did.Thus,itseemsclearthattheflowphysics which J\\nproduce thesetwophenomena aredifferent. Thebeauty ofthesecond phenomenon, \\nintermsoflungdiagnosis, isthatitshigher frequencies aremoreeasily \\ndiscerned abovethebackground levels intypical examination environments. \\nFurther testing should allow ittobeunderstoodand predicted justasisthe \\nfirstphenomenon.\\nDISCUSSION OFRESULTS \\nIntheirinitial visualization studies offlowinY-tubes, Schroter and \\nSudlow 2claimed tohaveobserved fourvortices inexpiratory flowoverthe \\nentire Reynolds number range50<Re<4500. Thisissupported bytheworkof \\nHardin, Yu,Patterson andTrible swhofoundthepressure/flow relation ina \\nlarger fourordermodelofthebronchial treenottovaryoverthisrange. The \\npresent study, however, suggests thatatleasttwodifferent phenomena occur in \\nthissameReynolds number range. \\nOnepossible explanation forthesediffering results isthatacritical \\nvariable isnotbeingcontrolled intheexperiments. Itisthepresent authors\\' \\nsuspicion thatthisvariable isthegeometry ofthejunction. Schroter and \\n, Sudlow2,whoused\"perspex\" tubes, madeaninitial studyofthiseffect. \\nTheyutilized twotubeshaving theratiooftheradius ofcurvature oftheouter J\\nwallofthejunction totheradius oftheparent tubeequal tooneandfour \\nrespectively andfoundthatalargeregion ofreversed flowoccurred inthefirst \\nmodelwhile theflowinthesecond remained attached. However, theeffect of \\nthecarina orflowdivider where thetwodaughter tubesmeetwasnotconsidered. \\n\\n8\\nInthepresent study,whereglasstubeswereemployed, theexperimenters \\nhadverylittlecontrol overthegeometry ofthejunction, havingtotake \\nwhatever theglassshopproduced. Thisoftenresulted inquitewavywallsin \\ntheregionofthejunction. Thus,sometubesweretestedinwhichnotonal \\nphenomena wereobserved. Othersweretestedinwhichthetonephenomena were \\nnotasdistinct asthosereported here.Suchassymmetries wouldalsoexplain \\ntheappearance ofmanyharmonics inthedata,whilethetheorypredicted only \\none.\\nInattempting tostudyalaminar flowphenomenon, particularly inthe \\nregionaboveRe=2000wherePoiseuille flowinthetubewouldtendtogo \\nturbulent 6,itisnotsurprising thatinflowandgeometric conditions should \\nbecritical totheexperiment. Thus,thepresent authors haveplanned afurther \\nseriesoftestswhichwillemploymachined tubesandrubberlinedtubesto \\ncontrol thegeometry andtoyieldmoreprecise inflowconditions. Thesecon- \\nsiderations arenotimportant intheactualhumanlungasphysiological surfaces \\ntendtobesmoothsuchthattheinflowislaminar. \\nAnother phenomenon whichwasobserved inearlier testswithlargertubes \\nwasthepresence oforganpipetones. Thesearereadily recognized asthey \\ntendtoformanalmostharmonic serieswithfundamental frequency givenapproxi- \\nmately.,,7_>\\nf=_ (3) 04L\\nwhere cisthespeed ofsound andListhelength ofthetube. Thus, thefre- \\nquency ofthisseriesoftonesdoesnotchangeastheflowinthetubeis , \\nchanged.\\nFinally, itisofinterest tocomment onthefactthatatleasttwo \\ndifferent phenomena wereobserved. Thisbehavior isreminiscent ofthat \\n\\n9\\nproduced byflowoveracylinder 8.AtlowReynolds number, thewakeconsists \\nofaveryorderly vortex street. Astheflowspeedisraised, thewakedegen- \\nerates intoaveryconfused motion inwhich noordercanbeobserved. Then, Q\\nwithastillfurther increase inspeed, theorderly vortex street returns once \\nmoreuntil, ataveryhighReynolds number, itdisappears andreturns nomore. \\nWhatmaybehappening intheY-tube isthattheflowisinitially inthe \\nstable fourvortex configuration observed bySchroter andSudlow2.Then,as \\ntheflowisincreased, thisconfiguration becomes unstable andconfused. A \\nfurther increase maythenfindtheflowinanewstable configuration, suchas \\neightvortices, which thendegenerates intoturbulence. Suchstatetransitions \\narequitecommonly observed inlaminar flows9,although precise prediction of \\nsuchbehavior hasnotyetbeenachieved. Moreextensive visualization and \\nmeasurement programs areplanned tobetter understand thisbehavior. \\nCONCLUSION\\nThispaperhaspresented experimental results which tendtovalidate a \\npreviously developed theory ofsoundgeneration inthehumanlungovera \\nparticular Reynolds number range. Inaddition, thepresence ofasecond \\nphenomenon isreported. Thesephenomena haveimportant application inthe \\ndiagnosis andprevention oflungdisease astheyallowthedetermination of \\nbronchial diameters fromspectra ofsoundproduced bythelung.

INTRODUCTION\\nOver the past several years, the NASA technology utilization program\\nhas supported several projects related to rehabilitation engineering and\\nproblems in aging. In the fall of 1977, NASA co-sponsored with the\\nVeterans Administration a conference on habitability in extended care\\nenvironments which highlighted the importance of providing the opportunity\\nvv...r. ce,n. I\\nnteractions aTiuic rGttttettt4S ^.I1 e7CG6IAa 6Q CAr@ facilitie s. 3`Iany\\nof the problems of disabled persons result in decreased opportunities for\\nindependent action and impromptu social interactions. This is particu-\\nlarly true of elderly persons with general physical disabilities and also\\nyounger physically disabled persons who lack sufficient upper body control\\nto be independently wheelchair mobile.\\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prrrhibits discalmination\\nr,\\non the basis of physical or mental handicap in any federally assisted\\nprogram or activity. Barrier-free design requirements for all public\\nbuildings have been adopted in Wisconsin as well as many other states,.\\nMuch of the implementation of this legislation has been targeted toward\\nincreasing the mobility of the disabled person who retains substantival,\\nupper torso strength. There arcs, however, substantial numbers of persons\\nwith various other disabilities whose requirements have been less ade-\\nquately addressed. A preliminary look at this area indicates that techniques\\n•( \\t . _..iii yam... \\t 6\\t _..\\t _ .. ,....0 \\t`9\\'^iiLlaWi16i+ti.^. \\t __ _._.\\nwhich permit increased social interactions and self-reliance by bedridden\\npersons in sheltered living facilities provide an excellent opportunity\\nfor application of NASA technology and expertise. Various telecommunications,\\ndisplay, input, control and information access techniques developed by NASA\\nare potentially applicable,s\\nIn December of 1177, the Wisconsin BATeam proposed to extend the\\n1177 year contract to undertake a program to better define problems of\\nelderly and disabled persons living in a sheltered cure setting which\\nmay be appropriately solved by the application of NASA technology,\\nparticularly by means of telecommunications and accessible information\\nsystems. The program was intended to enhance the visibility of NASA\\ncapabilities in this arena, and provide functional definition and con-\\nstraint descriptions. It also laid the groundwork for a reconfigurable\\nsystem suitable for integration into a model sheltered living environment\\nand increase the opportunities for Wisconsin BATeam involvement in\\nrehabilitation and other interagency programs.\\nAround the turn of the year, NASA and the National. Institute on\\nAging jointly sponsored two conferences to exchange information concerning\\nrespective programs and to develop areas of common interest. Many of\\nthe areas mentioned by the NIA representatives as being significant were\\nrelated to specific medical or physical limitation problems for which\\n0\\nNASA had previously completed projects or had current projects underway,\\nsuch as the Meal System for the Elderly, the weight alleviation device\\nto permit partial Weight bearing after hip replacement, and the female\\nurinary incontinence device. Meeting the psychologic and social needs\\nof the elderly and the handicapped was felt to be important but somewhat\\ndifficult to approach in terms of technology application.\\n-3-\\nSpeeific communications acids have been conceived but an integrated,\\nreconfigurable system capable of providing many of the information)\\ncommunications $ training, and entertainment functions required by persons\\nwith physical limitations line not been developed, The development of\\nsuch a system utilizing NASA, technology, appears, at least initially,\\nto be a worthwhile goal.VR\\'\\n+....,m...<,.,..^^ \\t .... yg„;a^^„^. ._....,may,.... \\t..-..^\\nit\\n11.

PROGRAM ACTIVITY\\nTask 1\\nProblem Identification and Significance Evaluation\\nIn order to gainn an appreciation of types and significance of the\\nvarious problems of the elderly and persons with physical limitations,\\nt\\nduring the first quarter of 1978, BATeam personnel visited several\\nnursing homes and gerontology and rehabilitation q,\\';+t^era. Numerous\\ni\\nkresearchers in the field were contacted and asked to evaluate various\\nproblems. A presentation of the NASA Technology Utilization program\\nwas made to a regional meeting of the Wisconsin Association of Homes for\\ni\\nthe Aged and significant problem descriptions were solicited. Solicited\\nproblems were enumerated and categorized as shown in Table 1. Perceived\\nsignificance ofg\\t problems by providers tended to follow their personal\\ninterests. For example, one researcher felt the most significant impact\\nI\\nof technology on the elderly would be an improvement in the maintenance\\nof gerontological bibliographies. Nursing home administrators, on the\\nother hand, were concerned with transferring patients, decubiti prevention,\\nand special diets.\\nIn order to develop, somewhat, a team consensus on the significance\\nof particular problems and the relative appropriateness of the application\\nof new technology, the problems were ranked by BATeam membera, using the\\nlist shown in Table 2. Results shown are the mean of the ranking of the\\nseven BATeam members.

In the course of these\\nintaractions. two new pr oblem statements were prepared, UW-53, \"Prepackaged\\nMeal System with Special Dietary Considerations for the Elderly,\" and UW-54,\\n\"Unobtrusive Alerting System to Protect Confused Elderly Persons.\" These\\nare reported in detail in the UW- BATeam quarterly report issued under\\nContract NAS5-24385, April-June, 1978.\\nTask 2\\nAttempts to solve several of these problems are currently underway by\\nnumerous groups including NASA. A number of the problems do appear to be\\namenable to solution by an integrated ialformation-communications-display\\nsystem. Accordingly, the BATeam is developing functional specifications\\nfor such a system.\\nThe system envisioned would pevmit a person with limited mobility\\nor sensory-motor .function to readily gain access to a wide variety of\\ninformation. Included would be self =case and self--triage medical\\nJ\\nt\\ninformation, vocational and other educational material ) recreational\\nmaterial, and the wide range of information currently supported by\\ninformation and referral services, In addition, communications capa-\\nbilities would be used to decrease psycho-soclal isolation and perform\\nremote medical monitoring. Environmental control could also be provided.\\nThe system would be modular and reconfigurable to meet the input ) output,\\nand storage requirements of \\t patients, The standard configuration\\nwould likely have voice input Mid .-Jice and/or raster scan cor *to output*\\nExamples of existing NASA technology that may be integrated into\\nthis system have been identified and are incorporated into the system\\ndescription under Task 3 below.\\nDISCUSSION\\nFurther investigation of the needs for assistive devices for inde-\\npendent living indicated a lack of compatibility among existing and\\ndeveloping devices. The efficient and optimal provision of assistive\\nsystems for the multiply disabled elderly will require a means of\\ninterfacing devices to work , together for the individual.\\nConcurrent with increases in the donation of life is a requirement\\nto maintain the quality of life. Dependency upon others for the conduct\\nof daily life activities is not only expensive but also damaging to\\none\\'s sense of self •worth. It has become generally recognized, both as\\na matter of public policy and from a humanitarian standpoint o that the\\nopportunity for independent living of elderly and disabled persons should\\nbe increased to the greatest extent possible,\\nThe UW--BATeam\\'s investigation on problems of the elderly has indicated\\nthat there is a spectrum of difficulties which elderly persons experience\\nand that there have been a large number of attempts to use technology to\\nsolve these problems individually. Sometimes this approach has resulted\\nin a device which is capable of only assisting one individual, or more\\noften is successful, to some degree, in assisting persons with the same\\ncategory of diminished sensory/motor capacity. Additionally, there appears\\nto be significant overlap in applicable technological approaches between\\nrehabilitation methods and assist systems for the elderly. Moreover,\\nelderly persons may, unlike the younger disabled, frequently have more than\\none area of diminished sensory/motor capacity. Thus, their ability to\\ntolerate an independent living situation may be dependent upon compensating\\nfor two or more of these sensory/motor limitations*\\nAn approach which will permit each individual elderly person requiring\\nassistance and support systems only those functions which are required\\nat a minimum cost would be facilitated by the development of a standardized\\ninterface system for control and communications among assistive devices\\nfor the elderly. The development of such a standardized system for\\ninterface would permit the efficient addition of functional modules\\n(e.g., voice syntehsizer system, medical status evaluation module) as\\nneeded by the individual. Many hardware and software functions have\\nalready been developed by various groups but cannot easily be used together\\nto assist the multiply disabled. The conceptual interface system mould\\navoid the necessity of duplication by an individual manufacturer\\'s\\npreviously developed systems for use with another manufacturer\\'s device.\\nDesign of assistive devices in a modular fashion \\'permits efficient\\nreconfiguration to meet the needs of individuals with particular sensory/\\nr Imotor .imitations. For example, a voice decoder 17odule would permit vocal\\nquadriplegics to control various functions such ^s automatic telephone\\ndialing, information access, environmental control, etc. The tactile\\ninput-output module would similarly permit blind and deaf persons to con-\\ntrol and access various support functions. In addition to being modular in\\nterms of hardware, such a system would have modular software so that resource\\nmodules could be added independently of one another. Some function capa-\\nbilities for compensation which are presently identified are:\\n- Patient education to improve self care and triage.\\n- Remote medical status monitoring.\\n- Automated communications to relieve psycho-social isolation*\\n- Sensory compensation.\\n- Motor compensation by means of environmental control.\\n- Memory support for those with failing recall.\\n- Vocational, educational, and occupation resources accessibility.\\n- Personal status monitor/alarm.\\n- Information and referral material\\n- Motivation and self-worth enhancement by interaction and positive\\nreinforcement.\\n- Recreation by means of entertainment access and games playing.\\nIn many cases, devices are available to perform one, or possibly more\\nassistive functions for disabled persons. There is, however, no provision\\nmade to facilitate the efficient interconnection of two or more of(--hese\\ndevices to provide an integrated system with all of the required functional\\nassist capabilities for the multiple disabled person. This is in marked\\ncontrast to other scientific and technical areas where interfacing standards\\nare widely used to enable interconnection and operation of different equipment\\ntypes from differing manufacturers to form a\\'complete system. Some examples\\nof these standard compatibility protocols are RS-232, IEEE 488, and the\\nS-100 standard.\\n..Zg_\\nSYSTEM DESCRIPTION (WITH TRANSFER POSSIBILITIES\\nA.

An investigationx\\nwas undertaken to examine the feasibility of an electronic memory compensation\\nn\\nsystem for use by elderly persons having this difficulty.\\nPreliminary Functional Concept: An assistive electronic device could\\ncompensate for short -term memory loss by presenting o pt demand or at\\nprogrammed times information necessary for the individual \\'s independent\\nfunctioning. Examples of this type of data are:\\n- Medication time, dosage, and special cautions.\\n- Dietary constraints.\\nSelf care methods (e.g., action recommended to stop acute heartburn).\\n- Appointments for doctor, dentist, and other necessary events.\\nShopping recommendations or restrictions.\\nThe _.concept selected for investigation makes use of an electronic\\nmodule connected to the users\\' television set. An internal clock would\\npermitprompting at\\'programmed times selected for the individual. \\tA\\nmessagecontaining the information (e.g., \"9:00 AM - Take 2 aspirin\\ntablets with water and record in log.\") would appear on the television\\nscreen. The user would also have a small selector keypad to enable inspection\\nof the stored information. During preparation for grocery shopping, he\\ncould press the \"Shopping\" button and see displayed :. recommendations and\\ncautions about what should or should r be purchased accordi p,g to his\\n..49_\\ndietary restrictions. Similarly, at the onset of an acute episode, he\\ncould press \"Medication\" and see displayed recommended steps and madica-\\ntions to terminate the condition. The device could be programmed in at\\nleast four ways:\\n1.Programmed by the user. This would require greater knowledge of the\\ntechnology of the device and the use of a general purpose keyboard,\\nI\\nboth of which may be imposing to some elderly persons.\\n2.Programmed by plug-in modules or cassettes. These would be updated\\nby the user\\'s doctor or other care providers and replanned by the user.\\n3.Programmed by visiting nurse or other care providers. During\\nvisits to assess user \\'s conditions and needs, revision as needed\\ncould be accomplished by a data entering device brought along at\\nthe visit.\\n4.The device could be both reviewed and updated via telephone modem.\\nThis raises the possibility of routine data retrieval regarding the\\nuser\\'s activity so that visits could be optimally arranged.\\nThe third alternative was explored first due to the fact that\\nregular home visits are already made by staff of the VA CHOP to their\\nclients.\\nNASA Technology: A caution and warning system (CWS) was developed by\\nJSC for biomedical monitoring and display of critical information (Figure\\n2). This concept was intended to be a 100% reprogrammable system to\\nscan for prioritized parameter inputs and generate a wide spectrum of\\nf\\nmessage, display, and alax^ l outputs. The generality and reconfigurability\\nof this concept are directly applicable to the prompting and information\\ndisplay system for the elderly.\\n—%n—\\nCaution and Warning System\\nA biomedical- monitoring  and display system\\nCan be used for Intensive-care and patient monitoring\\nLyndon B.

This receiver automatically selects and displays selected\\nbeacon bearings, resulting in fewer manipulations required by the pilot\\nfor navigation. The initial, design utilized an HP-9825 desktop calculator,\\nbut a ,lower cost system was subsequently developed using an MOS technology\\n6502 based microcomputer as the 8 bit computer control.. Another valuable\\nfeature in this latest device is implementation,of an ILR 488 standard\\ninterface to permit use in a wide variety of aircraft applications.\\nThese three concepts--reprogrammability, the use of flexible existing\\nmicrocomputer components, and a standard interface scheme--were basic to\\nthe design of the .demonstration device.\\nA feasibility mockup was assembled. Co-funding was obtained from\\nthe Graduate School at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. A commitment\\nhas been obtained from staff of the CHOP to place the device in clients\\'\\nhomes and conduct a field trial of the concept. The mockup was demonstrated\\nto members of a NASA site visit tear, ► in November and was completed in\\naDecember 1978.\\nPresent,Status\\nReview meetings have been held with the staff of the GHOP who will\\nbe supervising the first on-site evaluation. The first clients will be\\nan 80-year-old man and his wife who live in their own dwelling in a\\nsmall, rural Wisconsin town. The man has diabetes, a heart conditions\\nand severe loss of short-term memory. His wife\\'s short-term memory is\\nalso significantly impaired. Due to his multiple medical problems and\\n.,\\n-52-\\nassociated dietary constraints $ their ability to live independently is\\nmarginal because of poor compliance with necessary tasks. They are both\\nwilling to comply but are unable, due to memory lapses. The GROF staff felt\\nthat this living situation would be an appropriate environment to initially\\nassess the value and practicality of the prompting and information\\ndisplay system.\\nThe home evaluation is scheduled to begin the third week of January\\n1979.\\nFuture Directions\\nDiscussions have been held with staff of both the TRACE Center for\\nSeverely Communicatively Handicapped and the Wisconsin Foundation for\\nApplied Technology. Both groups have expressed interest in potertial\\ncollaborative work to adapt the system to meet allied needs in the\\ndisabled client populations targeted by their efforts. The goal is to\\ndevelop product concepts derived from the system, developed for the\\nelderly, and broaden the base of such a market to enhance likelihood of\\nlarger volume production of a \"core\" unit with the attendant cost advantages\\nof large production quantities.\\nAdditionally, the UW-DATeam has been asked by United Cerebral Palsy\\nof New York City to make a presentation before their Bioengineering\\nCommittee and to assist in adaptation of this NASA-developed intelligent\\ncontroller technology to the needs of their clients for increased influence\\nover their environment and a greater degree of independence (see attachedn\\ti\\nletter).\\nIt is anticipated that this visit will result in a definition of\\nfunctional needs and the exploration of a collaborative program to bring\\nw53-\\nabout the use of this advanced technology for the benefit of UCP clients.\\nThe generalized ,^ ti\\t concept described under Task 3 will in all probability\\nbo expanded and focusda as a result of this interaction.

Figure\\n3.19 displays the case of an isolated stripe. When an oscillating\\nnormal Field commonly called a tickle field, is applied, the\\nstripes straighten out. The bowing is caused by coerc vity the\\nstraightening out is caused by three factors: (l) The coercivity\\nis effectively reduced because the oscillating normal field \\t=\\ncauses the width of each stripe domain to oscillate somewhat,\\nhelping that stripe to move past micro-defects, (2) The stripes\\n_\\t „rePol eah eter rna%netostatipally. and (3) The o -s.cillatina fieldplus the-bias--field   exceeds the strip-out threshold at least part\\nof the time, causing the stripes to be in tension. If the ends\\nof the stripes were notljpinned to the ,,chevrons`, the stripes would\\ncontract to bubbles when the strip\"out threshold is exceeded.\\nHowever, when the ends are pinned, the stripes can only reduce\\ntheir l.encth, and therefore., lower their energy by straightening\\nout. This third cause is the subject of this sc.rrtion. Note Lhat\\na stripe near other stripes may see a local field higher than the\\nstrip-out field, although the external applied field, is less than\\nthe strip-out threshold for an isolated strip, because of the\\nstray field from nearby stripes. Therefore, this section will\\nconsider tbn^ case of an isolated stripe only.\\nFigure 3.19 shows an isolated stripe domain contracting under the\\ninfluence of an applied field H that exceeds the strip--out or run-\\nout threshold, HRO. The stripe is in the form of an arc, with\\nheight Z and width Y. The question to be solved is the mathemat.^-\\ncal, dependence of Z on H, HR O, Y, and W, the Width of the \\'stripe.\\nConsider an isolated non-pinned stripe of length L. Let the ap-\\nplied normal field, H, be equal to the strip-out threshold, HRO.\\nAt this field the stripe is free to contract or expand without\\nloss of energy. However, when the bias field is raised so that\\nit is higher than the strip -out field, the stripe contracts.

These equations indicate that the higher the bias\\nfield, the smaller the curvature, , or the larger the radius of\\ncurvature, Ro or the smaller the ratio of Z to Y.\\nAs an example, consider a garne `+ film with stripe width W w 3pm\\nand a coercivity of 0.1 Oe. Let the bias field exceedthe strip-out field by 10 tie. The radius of curvature according to equation\\n3.44 indicates that R * 150om. Zq q►tion 3.46 indicates that when\\nZ m Y, they both are equal to 150pm.\\nAs a second example, consider that the same garnet film with an\\napplied normal rf tickle field that reduces the coercivity by a\\nfactor of 10. The radius of curvature is now 1500pm or 1 *5 mm.\\nAs a final example, suppose the chevron rows are placed 1 mm\\napart. In this case, Y = 500om and Z = 86pm.\\nStripe domains wit in pinned ends can be made to reduce their curva-\\nture by application of a normal field higher than the strip-out\\nThe,curvature becomes much le-sA if a tickle fields OPAA\\nas well. Unless the coercivity is zero the curvat ,are will not be\\nzero; this means thot the read out track in a multilayer memory\\nwill probably have t.6 be similarly curved.\\n3.5 StriRe, Domain and MsIgnetig yea ure Counlin\\nIn order for stripes in a high 0 material to be straight in 4\\nmultilayer self-structured memory, they must be biased above the\\nrun-out threshold. The ends of the stripes must be pinned in or-\\nder to prevent the stripes from shrinking into bubbles. One\\nmethod of keeping the ends of the stripe pinned is with a permal-\\nloy strip at each end of the stripe, as shown in figure 3.21.\\nThe permalloy must supply enough normal field so that the end of\\nthe stripe is below the \\'run-out threshold, otherwise the stripe\\nend will shrink. The purpose of the following calculation is to\\ndetermine the pinning field from a per.malloy strip with no ap-\\nplied horizontal bias field. This field is a function of the\\nseparation, Z, between the garnet and the permalloy t as shown in\\nfigure 3.22, as wellias the thickness of the garnet film, h, and\\nthe stripe wavelength.\\nIt is assumed that the permalloy has infinite permeability for\\nhorizontal in-plane fields. This implies that the permalloy has\\nzero anisotropy and coercivity, and that when a stripe end ex-\\ntends under the permal2oy strip, the magnetization configuration\\nin the permalloy sets up a stray field that, inside the permalloy,\\nexactly cancels the horizontal component of the field from the\\n____\\n`\\t.-___-_^_^\\n*^\\n` ^«\\'o\\t`\\nc7\\t^\\n.\\n~\\n.\\n..\\t .\\n°\\n^^-\\n|\\t ^,\\t ^/\\n/^\\'\\n`\\n\\'\\n\\'\\t \\')\\n\\'\\n^.\\t r\\ny1^1 W M\\t ISM M^Y11R \\t M Yli a pt ^^ \\t ^^IM\\nIMAGEI\\tI\\tW F\\t\\'^\\tr= 1 \\tW\\tI i I\\tW\\nJ•I j\\t h\\n ^. ,.^.\\nPERMALLOY 2`\\tFILM STRIP ..._.,._..,\\nZ\\n—STRIP E\\n^\\' i)OMAIN \\'^\\' ^, fi \\'fi hGARNET\\nt\\nSUBSTRATA.\\nJ\\n1\\nF If i\\nFigure 3.22 \\tStripe Domain Pattern and image in a Pex^^al^ try\\nLayer.^ ^\\'\\nr,Y\\n3\\ni\\n1 i,\\n?,!\\n.\\t.eFy\\tski•,,. ra\\tt\\t^.\\nA\\n0\\nstripe.

The dead spot in the center (X 0) is then slightly less\\nthan 4 microns wide, while the dead spots at X = + 5 l.un are a\\nk\\t\\n\\thalf micron wide. The dead spots at X = + llum have scarcely\\nany width at all. Figure 3.28 shows where these dead spots are\\nlocated in relation to the pair of nested serpentine circuits of\\nfigure 3,,26. The dead spots of the upper circuit are on the top\\nof the picture, while those of the bottom are shown below. As\\ncan be seen, the x-position of the dead spots do not coincide.\\nTiles a stripe or bubble can be propagated by applying pulses of\\nalternating polarity between the two serpentine conductors. Each\\npulse moves the stripe or bubble to the next dead spot.\\nThis circuit can be used to propagate stripes by pulling on their\\nends, or it can be used to insert or remove a column of bubbles.\\nThe tact that only a single layer with only a single masking is\\nrequired is of considerable econoiY c interest. `\\'\\n3.6.3 Non-Nested Serpentine Conductors\\nFigure 3.29 illustrates the type of serpentine stripe propagators\\nevaluated and reported in section 4.3.2.

The stripes\\ncan then be propagated by propagating the stripe ends. The\\nstripe curvature was calculated and the maximum track width was\\nfound to be more than a millimeter. The pinning force between\\nmagnetic features and stripe ends was also calculated, as was\\nthe propagating force on stripes due to various current ac-\\ncessed propagation structures.\\nThe theoretical work indicates that a self-structured multi-\\nlayer device with a carrier layer containing stripes or stripes\\nand carrier bubbles magneto- statically  coupled to data bubbles\\nin a second layer is a very attractive configuration.\\n4. 9xPerimenta1 noes tea ions\\n4.1 O§J e_gt.J Y.\\nConventional bubble memories require the presence of at Least\\none propagation feature for each bubble domain.

This is & scanning\\nelectron micrograph of a serpentine pattern of the type success-\\nful in propagating bubbles. Because this has the appearance of\\na square wave on an oscilloscope,, this serpentine structure isr\\t also called a square wave conductor. The permalloy bars are\\nlocated to move the stripes off the regions where the fieldgradient is insufficient to cause domain motion, and also to be-\\ntermine which direction the stripes are to be propagated. The\\nexperiments indicated that a more complete circuit is required\\nto propagate stripes, a circuit that includes a stripe generator,\\nannihilator, a barrier to isolate the stripes from domains out-\\nside the propagation area ) and possibly means to prevent thestripe domains from collapsing.\\nExperiments were also carried out with a square wave circuitwithout the permalloy in order to provide information about the\\ncurrent strengths required to overcome stripe coercivity in typi-\\ncal stripe gernct t:a Fig-\" re- 4. 2 1-- a composite photograph of the\\nswitching of a narrow stripe end from one potential well to anadjacent potential well and back again using a 10 usec bipolar\\ncurrent pulse with a field amplitude of approximately 100 O\\'e,lam:\\ninstead of using magnetic features to move domains from low field\\ngradient regions, an alternative method of providing the offset\\nis to push by generating an excess of stripes on one end_. The\\nstripes repel each other with magnetostati.c force,- so when anew\\nstripe is generated, it pushes on its nearest neighbors, which\\nin turn push on their neighbors. The stripes are pushed by a\\ngenerator and pulled at the stripe ends by square wave serpentine\\ncircuits. An invention disclosure has been filed on this concept.\\nFigure 4.3 shows an experimental version of the circuit known as\\nan asymmetric sine wave. This circuit was fabricated from gold\\nand permalloy on glass substrates, and tested on both high and\\nlow Q garnets. Some preference of stripe ends was found for the\\nwidest part of the pattern, provided the garnet is biased for\\nvery narrow stripes. A stripe end will. slide along the circuit\\ntoward the wide part but moves only about one micron per current\\npulse. Hence, many pulses are required to move the stripe end\\nalong a quarter period of the circuit. It was not found possible\\nto observe stripe motion past the wide part with currents that\\nthe circuit could. safely support.\\nIL\\nFigure 4.1.

The °\\ndifference in the bubble nucleate field provides the bas^.s to\\nwrite data into the device. ^ low level current in a simple\\ngenerator loop will nucleate: a single bubble in the carrier layer,\\nand a h,^.gh level current will nucleate a double bubble ^- one\\nbubble in each layer.. Detection is based. on the difference\\nin the run-out threshold. A carrier bubble is placed in\\nthe detector and is tested by a current pulse, which reduces\\nthe local normal field below the run-aut threshold for a\\ndouble bubble, ^ douLle bubble will. strip out across the:.\\nexpander/detector, while a single bubble will not strip out\\nand no signal will be detected.\\nBubble and stripe domains can co-exist in the same garnet\\nlayer when biased above the rune=out threshold, since the stripes\\n` are prevented from collapsing to bubble domains by the end\\npinning action of the magnetic bias illustrated. in Figuxe 5,1.\\nCarrier bubbles in this layer are located between pairs of\\nstripe domains, and are evenly spaced due to mutual repulsion.\\n^,\\nr>\\nThe bas, \\'^^} advantage a^ the str^ .pe and bubble dea^ .gn is that\\nthe stale bubble positions axe defined\"by the input-au^put\\npropagate structure until a block is fully a.aad^d, and then it is\\nf^ransferred to the storage region. which is self structured\\nThis procedure greatly simplif^ss initialization and operation\\nof the. dr^vice. ^ penalty is paid in the loss of density due:to the stripe domains. \\t -^;as.k\\nA bubble generator and a magnetoresistive detector in the\\ncarrier sayer are combined with„a ourrent accessed circuit ^o\\nshut a row of bubbles, Forward and backward bubble propagation\\ncan be accomplished:, if necessary, with proper current phasing\\nin the circuit.

The sum total evaluation of all these parameters in the time frame in which\\nthe basic design approach was formulated, combined with the primary constraint that\\nreliable YSI arrays be produced that met the performance requirement, determined the\\nfinal design criterion,\\n1\\nka\\n6\\nP\\nf\\t\\n\\tVarious approaches for implementing the custom arrays were examined. These\\nincluded these three approaches:\\nManual layout and design and artwork digitizing\\nComputer interactive design and layout\\nComputer placement, routing and automatic artwork generation (LSI CMOS\\nstandard cell array approach).\\nB. SELECTED APPROACH\\nThe LSI CMOS standard cell array approach was selected as the method to mechnn-\\nize the CMOS LSI arrays. It 2 This approach uses a series of computer progr ams to\\nE\\t implement automatic placement and routing of a family of predesigned circuit functions\\nw\\t\\n\\t called standard cells into the desired logic function. The compute :programs then\\nautomatically generate a tape containing instructions to drive al t: ^i itomatic plotter, re-\\nsulting in final precision artwork. The standard cell CMOS LSI array approach is\\ndescribed in more detail later in this report.\\nThe standard cell circuit functions are eharaeterizO by circuits that vary in corn=\\nplexity from simple two-transistor inverters to complex. 20-transistor subsystems.\\nC.OTHER COMPUTER AIDS AND SIMULATION TECHNIQUES\\nCircuit, logic, and system simulation techniques were extensively used not only to\\n.minimize design changes and to shorten the design cycle, but more importantly to\\nthoroughly analyze, characterize, optimize, as well as to increase the reliability of\\nthe design.\\n1. Circuit and Device Simulation and Analysis\\nThe circuit cells, as well as larger sections of the array logic, were analyzed\\nand characterized by a special-purpose computer program capable of performing de\\n f\\nv\\t r;\\ncircuit arrays. y `l\\'.1` 0\\'\"This parameters of the device models used to characterize thea\\nMOS circuitry In the computer program are defined in terms of mark and process\\nparameters as well as conventional circuit characteristics. This permits the program\\nto accurately predict performance and operating characteristice; -of the final circuit\\narray in terms of the fabrication proposs ebaracteri sties as well as the circuit\\nparameters, \\t r\\n2.Logic Simulation (1,02SIM)\\nThe logic configuration for each of the two chip types was verified by the\\nLOGSIM (Logic Gate Simulator) S program. This computer program accepts as input\\nthe net list of the logic defined in terms of Boolean gates and automatically generates\\na series of output waveforms in response to a given set of input signals, The program\\ncan, compare the computed output 6-a stored sequence and automatically print out the\\tl:^\\nresults. Because LOGSIM can accept finite risetimes and accommodate gates with\\nvariable delay, the program can be used to check for timing tolerance or race co \\'ji-\\ntions. If the program encounters such a timing problem, it will print a spike, which \\t 1\\nIs to be interpreted as a possible timing problem..\\n3.AGAT Program (Automatic Generation of Array Tests)\\nr\\nIn testing the fabricated chips for correct functional operation, a,^est sequence\\nwas generated that not only verifies that the finished array performs the required logic\\nfunction, but also checks every gate in the system for the stuck at \"I\" or stuck at \"Q\"\\ncase. The automatic generation of test sequences fo r combinatorial logic was provided\\nfor by the Automatic Generation of Array Tests ? (AGAT) program. \\'\\'These bit sequences\\nor patterns were programmed into a programmable tester, which not only tested the\\n^\\t\\n\\t chips for proper operation but also identified those outputs where the error occurred;\\'\\nand the corresponding bit sequences which resulted in an error condition.\\t\\n((,,\\t is\\t\\nf ^\\tJ\\nC^l\\nD.

If\\nOF PkVR QUALITY\\n11\\n^^\\t Section 11\\nSELECTED APPROACH: CMOS LSI STANDARD CELL ARRAYS\\nThis section describes the CMOS LS1 standard cell tothnique used to design and\\ngenerate the multiplexer register chips. The approach Is essentially an automatic\\ntechnique for generating precision mash artwork for LS1 arrays using design. automa-\\ntion techniques. The method is based on a family of custom -designed circuits called\\nstandard cells which are stored on a library tape and which can, under computer pro-\\ngram control, Tyne recalled from memory to order , ,^ mechanize a specific function or\\nlogical configuration. The method essentially consists of three components.,\\n1)a series of design automation computer,programs\\n2)a family of custom CMOS circuits called standardcells\\n3)a basic standard cell array topology.\\nA\\nA. DESIGN AUTOMATION COMPUTER PROGRAMS\\nThe CMOS LS1 standard cell design automation programs are a family of computer\\nprograms that accept as input data the logio diagram defined in terms of the standard\\ncells and generates an output tape containing the Instructions for an automatic plotter\\nto generate precision mask artwork for the LSE arrays. These programs contain the\\nfollowing basic subroutines.\\n1. Placement Program\\nThis program performs an automatic placement based on an algorithm which\\nseeks to minimize total Interconnection length and number of crossovers. The pro-\\ngram wil l continue to evolve new ptnepnivnts based on the best of the previous place-\\nments for a period specifted by a program parameter. \"I\\'lic output of the placeniont\\nprogram automatically becomes (lie Input data for the routing program,\\n2.Routing Program\\nThe routing program Is designed to Interconnect the selected standard cells In\\naccordance with the original not list. The heurlstle algorithm seeks to minimize, total\\nwire length and crossovers. In addition, the program endeavors to give preference to\\na metal interconnect as opposed to it P4 tunnel or diffusion Interconnection. The type\\nof connection made Is determined automatically by tile routing program, It the program\\nimplements a connection, or a portion of an Interconnection, with a P+ diffused tunnel,\\nthe program will then automatically place an N+ guard baud around the tunnel to mini-\\nmite tb(,- effect of any parasitic device that could be formed with an adjacent tunnel.\\nA unique feature of this algorithm Is that successful Interconnection of all the\\nrequired signals is guaranteed. The program will attempt to minimize chip area with\\nthe constraint that the chip has boon Interconnected faithfully In accordance with the til-\\nput not list. When the routing program has completed tilt ,, Intorconnectivity list, It will\\nautomatically generate an output data format that Is accepted by the artwork program\\nunless optional manual Intervention occurs. In order to facilitate uniform bonding pad\\nplacement on tile perimeter of the chip, as well as to Improve the performance r,,f the\\narray, the optional manual intervention mode will be exercized, To aid in effe eting\\nthe manual changes desired, a manual modification program Is used. With the use of\\nthis program tilt the required manual changes are effected. To ensure that these changes\\nhave been Implemented correctly, a composite plot Is made oil a local plotter whose\\noutput Is of sufficient accuracy to provide the required checking. After the modified\\nwiring has been checked and verified, a data format containing tile required placement\\nand routing Information is generated that is accept&I by\"the artwork program.\\n3.Artwork Program\\nThe artwork program takes the ^W -Ilffied output of the placem(int, and i-outing,\\nprogram, combines It with the circuit and cell data retating to those stared cells which\\narea used In the particular logic, and generates a mugnet;v tape that contains lilt the4\\nnecessary instruction and Information that results to the generation of the seven-loved\\nmask artwork (usually at 80X) using a Gerber automatic plotter,\\nB, STANDAim\" CELL CIRCUIT FAMILY\\nThe standard-cell circuit library Is a set of logic circuits that have been defined,\\n•\\t configured, designed, topologically laid out, chcaod, antilyzod, stmulated, validated\\nand then stored permanently. The cells range In complexity from a two-dovice Inverter\\nto complex super cello having more than 20 devices. The present standard colt family\\nconsists of more than 40 \"Its.\\nThe standard cell designation to used because all cells In tho family must be multi-\\nples of a standard height. All Input anqoutpll connections to each call are made via\\nthe input/output cell pads located at the b\\'6\\'ttom,  of each cell,\\nTable I contains a list of the cell types and functions that are used In the multi-\\nplexer register chip type 1. Nine standard cell types are used to Implement the logic\\nof the 001A chip type.\\nTable 2 contains the standard cell circuit complement for multiplexer register\\nchip type 2, the 002A array. This array type uses 11 standard cell array types, two\\nof which are flip-flops, Cell 1820 Is a D-type master-slave flip-flop operating with a\\npositive pulse. Cell 1830 is a D-type storage flip-flop.\\nC. STANDARD CELL ARRAY TOPOLOGY\\nAn Integral part of the standard-cell approach centers on the design and layout of\\nthe standard cell array topology. The topological layout was designed to be compatible\\nwith the available process and design rules, white allowing the design automation com-\\nputer program to lay out an optimized topology. The microphotographs In Figs. 3 and\\n6 are examples of the basic layout. The row of back-to-bacU cells with a oommon\\nground between them is characteristic of the standard cell topology.

Dynamic Performance at Ambient Temperature\\nli f\\n^f\\tTwo CMOS LSI standard cell chips, the ATL -NASA teat chip and the ATL-\\n000, have been under continuous dynamic stress at 25 0C since 28 May 1971. No de-\\ngradation in dynamic performance has occurred.\\nf\\ni\\n1\\n!\\t22\\nj\\n{4. Propagation Delay\\na. Propagation Delay of Master-Slave Cell 1820\\nThe No. 1820 master-slave flip-flop cell is used on both the 001A and\\n002A chips. This flip-flop, shown in detail in Fig. 0, is a single-input D-type master-\\nslave register in which not only can the data, D, be Jam-transferred into the master\\nregister (the combination of G3 and G4), but the input can be multiplexed from a com-\\nmon bus because of G2, which is used to isolate the D Input line from the master\\nregister. The Jam-transfer capability with a single input arises out of the special high\\nimpedance (low capacitance) characteristics of the CMQS technology combined with the\\nspecial design of the y G2 and G4 gates. The GPI gate is designed with very low conduc-\\ntance devices that keep the output Impedance of G1 high enough so that it can be driven\\ndirectly from the data, D, through G2, but low enough. that It can hold the stored data\\nIn the master register, which consists of G3 and G4. Gate G5 Is a bidirectional switch\\nthat is used to isolate the slave register, GO and G7, when new data is being stored in\\nthe master. Figure 10 shows the complete logic contained on the PRR (ATL 001A) chip.\\nJ\\tA data input pulse to the 001A (or 002A) passes through three stage delays before reach-\\ning the master-slave flip-flop. The clock pulse passes through two stage delays, and\\nthe output from the master-slave flip-flop passes through one stage delay before reach-\\ning the output of the cWfi . The internal stage delays on the chip guarantee that the\\npropagation delay associated with the master-slave flip-flop will be no worse than the\\ndelay measurements made at the inputs and outputs of the chip. This condition is illus-\\ntrated in Fig. 11.\\nThe solid lines represent waveforms at the inputs and output of the chip,\\nwhile the dashed lines represent waveforms at the inputs and output of the master-slave\\nflip-flop, As can be seen; chip time delay measurements are always greater than or\\nequal to the master-slave time delays. Three timing measurements were made; on the\\n001A master-slave flip-flops. The first measurement is designated the \"ripple through\"\\ntime, which is the minimum time necessary to place a bit of Information at the flip-floper\\nORIGINAL; PA()X\\n4F, POOR QUALI TVL\\nr\\tIco\\nv iI \\tv\"\\t4^ \\t f\\t\\nC?\\t .r,,;\\n\\tA v,1 ^ LL\\t I\\t N -Z ..^ \\td\\nf\\t 00l 140\\n0\\nlo\\t\\nI NN\\t ^R\\ny\\na ,,\\n ell\\nQ W\\na^\\tL\\nbbt0\\nw\\nw\\n4\\t^\\na\\n24\\nF\\t,v\\nORIGINAL.

Two delay measurements were made oil\\nD flip-flop. They are designated as the \"direct feedthrough\\'\" time and the I\\'D clocked,\\noutput\" time. In the direct feedthrough test, the clock inputs (pins 12 and 13) to the D\\nflip-flops were held high so that Input information could pass directly through the flip -flop. Propagation delay was measured between the input and output of the flip-flop, For\\nthe D clocked output tests a data level was p laced at the input of a D flip-flop and then\\nthe clock input was enabled (rising edge pulse), The propagation delay was measured\\nbetween the enabling clock edge and the flip-flop output. The timing waveforms for file\\ndirect feedthrough and We D clocked output testa are shown In Fig, 17,\\nRepresentative data for the direct feedthrough and D clocked output Wsts\\nIs presented in Table 12. For 10-V operation and an average total node capacitance of\\n10. G pF the average direct feedthrough propagation delay associated with a rising edge\\nInput is aG ns. For the falling edge input the average propagation delay is 33 ns. For\\nthe D clocked output test, the average delay from a positive clock edge to a positive\\noutput edge is 50 us.

These LSI arrays,\\nwhich used the CMOS circuit technology, were designed and fabricated by using the\\nstandard cell design automation technology. This technology uses a se\\'rics of design\\nautomation computer programs, combined with a fai4ily of previously designed and\\nstored circuits called standard cells, to generate precision mask artwork for the LSI\\nCMOS arrays.\\nMultiplexer to gister chip type I is fabricated on a 0. 143 x 0. 123 inch c1dip. The\\nlogic is implemented by using nine standard cell types for a total of 54 standard cells,\\nThis Involves more than 360 transistors and has the functional equivalent of Ill gates.\\nMultiplexer register chip type 2 is fabricated on a 0.12 x 0.12 Inch die. it uses 13\\nstandard cell types for a total of 42 standard cells. The chip contains more than 300\\ntransistors, the functional equivalent of 112 gates.\\nThe circuits are housed In hermetically sealed 40--pin dual-inline ceramic pack-\\nages and subjected to the standard )(C qualification testing procedurer5. To pass the\\ninitial, screening, all circuits were tested f& , correct functional operation.

The initial analysis will be carried out\\nmore generally to include a current in the plasma as well as a heat flux. This will facilitate com-\\nparisons with the results of Kindel and Kennel (l) who investigated these modes driven by a current\\nonly.\\nWe wish to find a dispersion relation for w (k) parameterized by the ratio of electron to ion temper-\\nature and also the growth rate, P, as a function of the wavenumber k. We then wish to specializef,\\nthese results for the special case of marginal stability for which r(k) 0 and find the threshold\\ndrift speed above which the plasma is unstable to the EIC and IA modes. Finally we will find ex-\\npressions for these quantities for the limits \\t T- ^^ ^, \\t and\\t^ -0 1 o\\nA self -consistent distribution function will be derived in the next 4)ction using Chapman-Enskog\\ntheory to represent an electron distribution including a heat flux characterized by a thermal\\nconduction speed, v. and also an electric current characterized by a drift speed, u. Tile ions will\\nbe represented by an isotropic Maxwellian distribution. In the third section this distribution will\\nbe used to find the dispersion equation and growth rate for the low frem ,,eiicy, W 4-4.M.+rt\\nelectrostatic modes. In section IV marginal stability will be assumed while the contribution of\\nthe electron current will be dropped and the dispersion equation simplified for the two modes,\\nEIC or IA. Here an expression will also be given for the minimum conduction speed above which\\nthe plasma becomes unstable. The limits \\t r\\t and _ - T== •• \\tT\\n^.

The only way in which electrons can transfer ente2 A*ahtcr than\\ni\\nthe electron thermal speed is by directed (rather titan random) motion. This is a current and gives\\nthe current instabilities.\\nThe second point to note is that the graphs given here for the heat flux instability do not markedly\\ndiffer from those Kindel and Kennel have produced for the current instability. This has already\\nbeen mentioned in the analysis for Ti >> 1,\\nFrom the graphs it can be seen that the results here differ from Kindel and Kennel \\'s by 10-20\\nnear = I and are essentially identical when is greater than 3 to 4.\" This means that the two\\nInstabilities can be \"combined\" when T► is greater than unity, That is, the fact that a and v.\\ndon\\'t enter into tho real and imaginary parts of the dispersion equation in an identical manner is\\nirrelevant for Le > 1. Thus we can take the critical drift velocity curves and replace either u (in\\nKindel and Kennel\\'s curves) or v c (in our curves) by the combination u + v e for Tr > \\'1, For\\nexample, the minimum critical velocity for the instability to occur with T► 3.0 is about, 12.\\nThus we can say that if the sum of the heat flux drift velocity and the current drift velocity;\\nvc +u>.12\\nthen the instability will occur, Thus, the existence of a heat flux can cause a current carrying plas-\\nm to be unstable to the EIC or IA modes even if it were not unstable with the current alone (and\\nr\\nvice versa), In a solar flare, for example, the conditions which lead to a current also will give rise\\nto a heat flux and the combination make the plasma less stable than either alone.\\n\\'\\t\\n\\t Thi\\'^ th3rd^point of interest is that the two modes, EIC and IA, exist as separate entities with the\\nlowerminimum critical velocity for the rilC mode when Ti < 8,5 while the IA mode has the lower\\nTe\\t > 1 and the IA minimum critical velocity for ^ > 8,5, The EIC mode is characterized by \\'u\\nmode by \\t 10-5 (from the numerical solutions). Consequently when Te is somwy iat lessTi\\n3\\n4\\nthan or greater than S.5 the two modes will both occur, one propagatin g parallel to the field and\\nthe other perpendicular to it, if the actual drift velocity is somewhat greater than the minimum\\ncritical value. For example, if the drift velocity is roughly 30 % above the minimum critical value\\nthen both wave modes would co-exist in the range e from 7,n to 10.0, Since particle acrele pli(n\\nin solar flares depends on the presence of the EIC mode l this gives a wider possible rang ^n tem-\\nperature over which it can occur if the drift velocity is only slightly above the minimum value,\\nSome results not ,found in the graphs or the analysis but which arc seen in the numerical results\\nare that some parameters can be changed by large amounts with correspondingly small changes in\\nvc. In the EIC mode calculations it was found that the minimum critical drift velocity is only\\nweakly dependant on the value of Ti. For example, ate: 10, a change of 20% in kkl produced\\nonly a 2% change in vc and this is a typical result, Thus the growth rate of the EIC mode is not\\nstrongly peaked about one value of - ; when v. slightly exceeds vem we would expect that thei1\\ndestabilized wave will contain a spread in k Thus the wave will propagate in a cone around\\nthe magnetic field and the angular thickness of the cone will be appreciable compared to the angle\\nthe side of the cone makes with the field line.\\nFor the IA mode, the preferred direction of prop4gation is very nearly exactly parallel to the\\nmagnetic field with k.,/k l 1 < 10\"\\'.

            "['62', '63', 'Vehicle systems design optimization study', 'The optimum vehicle configuration and component locations are determined for an electric drive vehicle based on using the basic structure of a current production subcompact vehicle. The optimization of an electric vehicle layout requires a weight distribution in the range of 53/47 to 62/38 in order to assure dynamic handling characteristics comparable to current internal combustion engine vehicles. Necessary modification of the base vehicle can be accomplished without major modification of the structure or running gear. As long as batteries are as heavy and require as much space as they currently do, they must be divided into two packages, one at front under the hood and a second at the rear under the cargo area, in order to achieve the desired weight distribution. The weight distribution criteria requires the placement of batteries at the front of the vehicle even when the central tunnel is used for the location of some batteries. The optimum layout has a front motor and front wheel drive. This configuration provides the optimum vehicle dynamic handling characteristics and the maximum passenger and cargo space for a given size vehicle.', 'Gilmour, J.

The number of battery modules is reduqd from the specified 18 to 14 \\nwhich reduces the total energy of the pttery set fbm 32,400 WH to 25,200 WH. \\nI This still provides a 57.5% gain in energy vs the 16,@\\'0 WH of the base lead-acid type \\ni ~nd also provides a 156 lb, ~eduction in weight for the battery set vc, the base line package, The gain \\nin energy per vehicle weight is therefore: \\nI \\n\\n\\nIn spite of the reduction itr number gf batteriq recommended by Argonne, a two-tt,ird$ \\nimprovement In watt hours per pound of vehicle weight catl be aaoomplished plus an \\nacceptable installation packaga can bo achiqivod, This wciuld appealv to be a desirable \\n_ compromise, \\nPmm tha prcvious analysis it is apparent that battery madule size is extremely important to the optimizing of electric \\nvehicle component pd&koging. The present \\n11 lead-acid modulo size of approximately 10 X 7 X 11 in. (L X W 7 H) is optimum for \\nI installation in a current production vehicle conversion and furt hn errnorb W\\'ould also be optimum for unique \\nelec),tric vel~iclo designs since additional battery space could only \\nbc achieved by n@iiic?rIdi vehicle size snd wolgl~t. Thewiow it is ~reoornmm3ed that \\nfuture battery development be directed toward a module size similar to the current \\nlead-aq# type. Other dimensional confiyrations are possible if the total battery set can \\nbe effectively gmuped in the spaces designated in PlO. \\'li. It is essential that \\nS front and rear battery mounting areas be utillzed since an acceptable vehicle @eight \\ndistribution cannot be achieved with bntteriss locatad at only Qnc end of the vehicle. \\n\\'It is glso importc~nt that a major improvement in battery en~rgy/pound be achieved so \\nthat the p6portion of battery weight tb veh!cla w~ight be reduced. \\n0 \\'Ji \\nThe optimum battery mounting locatiod\\' for the nickel-zinc type in the front and rear of the vehicle \\nBre bnsed on use of n caqbination of battery rnqdu$&\\' similar \\nin total volume requirdmbt to the current \\'lead-acid. Jn the many loc lion studies conducted no \\nsther $uit*ble locations were found. i \\n-, \\ni/ I \\n/- 4 10 \\n, A final analysis of the effeot of battery shape involved theiitotential fa using \\nkq more radical module configurations. Two areas sometimes mentioned for battery location are under the \\nflow and in t$ sill. Neither of these locations would appear , \\n= to have ciriy future potential. The space under the floor as shown in FIG, 14, does I \\n/r \\nt\\' not have adequate( height in a small car to accommodate batteries, Battery heights\\'\" \\' \\nJ I \\n1 n 7 1\\' 32 \\nJ \\nLt * @- . \\' \\nL-\\' \\nFRONT FLOOR I> \\nof 2\" are obviously not practical and a portion of the aroo (war seat foot well) has I j \\neven less height. Tha only practical area would be under the rear per+ which is limited \\n( \\'4 \\nto abwt 3800 cu. In. Cornpared to a volume roquirenlent of 14,000 cu. in. for the 1 I \\nlead~acid.~ppckage and 17,000 cu, in. for the nickel-zinc, this area would not wnrrent \\nserio~~s consideration as it could only be used as a third pack cornpllcating the packaging \\nemblem and adding to weight. Furthermore, dnce it would limit the battery height \\n4 \\nto about 8\", the total. battery area requirement would be increased and packaging \\nI j \\nfurtller complicated. A reduction of battery ?height is not considered feasible by \\nbattery davelopment gmps since the top and bdttom structures of the module are relatively \\nfixed d mensiow and reducing height reduces the wakln8 height of the plates \\nnnd electrolikf , 1 hich cannot be recovered effectively by lrvger area. The module therefore becomes increasingly \\ninefficient as height is decreased and structure and \\nthorefare weight are Increased. This relationship is oxactly the oppasitc from the goal of tha battery \\ndevelopers which is to increase tb efficiehcy of the module at reduced \\nweight, , \\nRaising thc floor lieigt~t to accornmaiiaie tx higher battery module would decrease legroom or raise \\ncar overall height and weight - both undesirable results. Furthermore, to accommodate \\nan efficient bdttery module height, floor height would have to be raised obout \\n9\\'1 - an impractical amount to raise the car height from the standpoint of \\nappearance and entry and exit os well as we\\'igl$. In addition, current battery weight \\nin this position (under the floor) raults in e histribution of 6116 front with o resultant front \\nweight of about 1900 lbs. As previously discussed this is unacceptable for \\nsteering effort. Some batteries would still have to be mounted under the cargo \\ncompertment floor. This appmacl is not recommended for consideration unless some \\nmajor breakthrou,gl~ in battary construction and internal operation occures. \\nMounting batteries in the sill would seriously restrict entry \\'knd exit conditions \\nI and passenger seating space. FIG. 15J~hows the increase in sill height ond width p- kegitired to accommodate a practicakjbattery module. Furthermore, the available \\ni volume would still only be about 6000 cu. in.. - less than half of the requirement for \\nR lead-acid module and one third for a nickel-zinc. Some batteries would stfld have \\nI to be mounted in both front and rear areas to rnointaik proper weight distribution. Because of the negative effects on comfort ond convenience \\nwitllout improvement in battery \\npacknging, this approach is not recommended. \\ni< \\nBASELINE LEAD-ACID SIZE 7 \\nSILL \\nFigure 15 SILL\"BATTERY MOUNTING CONDITIONS \\n2.3 Dynamic and Static Analysis t) \\nIn order to verify that the selected electric vehicle layout wouid be acceptable for dynamic handling \\ncharapteristics, an analytical study was conducted by MGA \\nResearch Corporation. MGA had previously conducted an analytical study of electric vehicle handling dynamics under contract to \\nJPL (Contract No. 955312). The program utilized was a computer simulation of two basic vehicle dynamic maneuvers: o Trapezoidal Steer Input \\n- This maneuver characterizes the transient response of a vehicle to a suddenly applied steer input of \\na specific angle. The steering angle \\nis held constant after the rapid input. An initial velocity of \\n40 MPH is used. The magnitude of steer angle can be increased until the limit of \\nlaterial adhesion is reached resulting in either a plowing condition (understeer), \\nlaterial drift (neutral steer), or spin oubt (oversteer). For the purpose \\nof comparison in thk analysis steer ar,gl:les were not increesd t~ \\nthe limiting condition. \\n/I \\no Sinusoidal Steer Input - This input simulates a rapid lane change steering \\nI \\nI \\\\ maneuver and consists of two symmetrically opposite steering angle inputs. \\'4 \\nInitial speed is 45 MPN and the steering input is defined as a sine wave \\nr 1 \\nwith a period of 2 seconds and various angular amplitudes. i i \\n1 \\ni \\nI ; \\nI These maneuvers are recognized in the vehicle dynamics field as being indicative 1 \\nj I of the hnndling characteristics of a vehicle encountered in normal driving situations. I i \\nt I However, it is important to recognize that vehicle handling qualities are highly subjective \\nin nature and it is difficult to determine by simulation whether a given vehicle wilL i \\nid \\n1 handle ltgoodu or \"badtt except in a general sense. Production passenger cars exhibit \\n0 \\nt a wide range of dynamic characteristics and the development of a vehicle requires \\n! clesim~ compromises in sever~l areas including handling. The handling characteristics of the selected \\nEV configurations were theref ore evaluated by comparing recognized dynamic response values with those of the base vehicle using the same control inputs. The \\nevalu&tion was therefore rel~tive to a production vehicle which possesses handling qualities suitable for the \\ngeneral public. \\n1;. \\n3 6 \\ni,\\' \"\\' 0 ----- D \\n- -.- A-, - - & L I1l*L-LI&-CI-hll ---.. \",*--.C-*-OI-X .,.^O.. -. -_. __ A \\nMGAts ~xperionce in the dynamics field also provided them with the necessary expertise to statically evaluate \\nvminus vehicle characteristics with respect to their effect \\non vehicle handling. Eighteen possible electric vehiele companent installation \\nmtudies were reviewed with MGA, all of which were based on using the Dodge Omni base vehicle, Two wore selected by static oharaateristics analysis \\nas representing the range of weight distribution that would \\nba expacted to reflect good EV component \\npackaging while at the same tim~ providing acceptable vehicle handling characterbtics. \\n(Lee, similar to the Omni.) One of the configurations !INN utilized the optimum approach \\nfkom a packaging standpoint (Ref, FIG* 4) and has a weight distribution close to that of the base, vehicle. \\nThe other layout 1\\'5\" has batteries located in the tunnel area as well \\nas front and re&. The two were selected to provide not only a range of weight distribution but also the effect of battery distribution in the vehicle, The engineering characteristics of the Omni base vehicle required for the handling simulations were obtained from the \\nChrysler Corporation, The dynamic handling characteristics of the base vehicle and the two selected electric drive derivations were \\nthen c?~lrlu~ted by roams nf thF computer -slrnlir&i~ pmgrem-. \\nIn both of the selected simulated maneuvers the two EV configurations performed in a \\nmannor genarally similar to the base car. It was necesswy of course to revise suspension spring \\nkates and provide appropriate tires to accommodate the ~dditional \\nweight of the electric vehicles. While configuration I1Nn (weight distribution closest to base vehicle) responded in \\na manner more similar to that of the base car than configuration \\nltJfl, thore is really no significant difference in their dynamic character- I \\nistics. Both electric vehicles were within the response characteristics envelope of current production vehicles. Responses of \\nthe vehicles to the simulated trapezoidal maneuver \\n~t steering inputs of 2\\' and 8\\' are shown in FIG. 16. Responses to the \\nsinusoidal inputs of 2\\' and 8\\' are shown in FIG. 17. Additional comparisons of,the 1 relative responses of the EV propaals comptlred to the base vehicle in the trapezoidai\\' \\nmaneuver are shown in FIGS. 18 thru 22. FIGS. 20, 21 and 22 indicate the performance levels to be not only similar \\nbut within tho envelope of existing production vehicles. Additional comparisons of responses in the sinusoidal maneuver are shown in FIGS, \\n23 \\nand 24. Again response characteristics are generally similpr to the base vehicle and within production vehicle limits, \\nA more complete discussion of the theory and \\ncomparitive results of these simulations will be found in the complete report of MGA \\non their work which is provided in APPENDIXL&, \\n1 \\nI , \\nI \\nI \\ni \\nI t CONFIGURATION \"J\" \\nI I \\nI r, \\nt \\nI \\nI 1 \\nI \\nI \\nI n \\nI \\nr \\nI ! \\nI \\n, \\nFigure 16 RESPONSE TO TRAPEZOIDAL STEER INPUT \\n38 \\n-&. \\n- - --A- & A - - - fl - 0 0 \\nCONFIGURATION \"JL\\' CONFIGURATION \"N\" / CONFIGURATION \\'IJ \\n*, \\n0 \\n.-, -- 0 \\n3 \\nFigure 17 RESPONSE TO.

The final selection of battery locations was based on: o \\nWeigbt distribution to provide dynamic hand87~ characteristics similar to the base internal combustion engine vehicle, and front weight limited to a magnitude that would not result in excessive manual steering effort. \\nU \\no Space available in the vehicle envelope without increase of size or \\nI significant intrusion into passenger or cargo areas, The foregoing stipulations required the division of the \\nrequired 18 batteries into two packages, The front pack of \\n6 batteries is under the hood directly behind the grill, The rear pack of \\n12 batteries is located under the cargo area floor. FIG. 25 \\nillustrates the relative locations of the two packs, The support structures developed to mount the battery packs in the \\nOmni base vehicle are shown in PIGS. \\n26 and 27. The same general method of supporting the batteries is \\nutilized for both front and rear mountings. Each battery is supported by a channel section around the base and is clamped in \\nposition by a lighter channel section around the hold down ledge of the battery case. FIG. \\n28. The channel supports are welded together to form a single frame for supporting the pack. The upper hold down channels are also joined to form a\\'single frame. The lower \\nsumort frame and \\nuppkr hold down frame are clamped together by long bdts. The weight of the pack is supported in the \\nvehicle by cross channels welded to the bottom of the frame. These in turn are bolted to the \\nbody structure rails. The rear pack is removed from the bottom. The front pack must \\nbe lifted w.wgsd through the hood opening for \\n\\'7 \\nremovaL Removal from the bottom would require a bolt-in front vehicle structure \\ncrossr:lember as the battery pack overlaps it. Since this is a key structural member is is recommended that it be left welded insuring a more secure joint. The offset between rows of batteries in the front pack \\nis necessary to clear the transmission \\nt .- -. ..A- -s ILL- J \\nFigure 26 FRONT BATTERY PACK MOUNTING STRUCTURE \\nFigure 27 REAR BATTERY PACK MOUNTING STRUCTURE \\n\\ncase in the middle and the headlight cans at the side. Weights of the battery supports \\nI are: (Using Hot Rolled Low Carbon Steel) Front \\n25 lbs, \\n,,Rear 40 lbs, \\nNo structural changes are required a4 the front of the base vehicle to accum- \\nmodate the battery pac!:. However, same stiffening of the front rails might be required because of the added weight of the batteries and electric drive components, This could \\nbe accomplished by heavier gage in a new design or sddition of a reinforcing \\n~ember for the base vehicle. At the rear, the structure crossmembers, ahead of and behind the pack, must be redesigned to modify \\ntheir cross-section. They also must be moved slightly farther apart to accommodate the battery mounting. Heavier gage rear rails \\nor the addition of reinforcements could be anticipated because of the addition of the load of the batteries \\n(720 Ibs.). The cargo floor must be raised 6\" to clear the battery pack. None of these changes are considered \\nstgnificant enough to alter the base vehicle\\'s structural integrity. They will also add only a minor weight penalty of a few pounds. Since the basic structure of the vehicle is not affected by the battery installations, the crash worthiness should be \\nunimplsired. In fact, the addition of the battery pack mass \\nand support structulee should improve the ability of the vehicle to maintain the integrity of the passenger compartment in either \\nu front or rear impact. The batteries themselves offer considerable energy absorbing capability \\nin a crush resistance situation, \\nI No specific vehicle layouts of the battery support systems were considered ! 1 \\nI necessary since they are similar to the ETV-1 systems and did not appear to offer any installation problems. The three systems are: o Electric Component Wiring Connections Cables are required to connect the batteries to the motor and wiring \\n1 \\n\\\\ connections between motor and controls must be provided. The location \\n! of the batteries and controls directly adj~cent to the motor greatly , A\\' \\nsimplifies the wiring. The cable from the reaai battery pack can be routed down the small tunnel in the center of the vehicle along with the parking \\nbrake notuntion cable, Tiris tunnel was provided in the baso vohiola to , \\nll stiffen thc underbody and provida space for tho cirxhaust system, \\nI o Battery Wa+ ring and Venting System 1;\\' I \\nb This Is a dual function system and is provided to eliminate thQ need far \\nindividual battery fluid replacement and to vent any escaping gases away from the \\nvicinty of the batteries, A sclwmatic! of tho system as installed \\ni ) \\n\\' in the ETV-1 Is shown in FIG. 29, Because of the separation of the \\nI battery packs betwean front and rear of the vehicle it is recommended 1 \\nthat two separate systems, ono for eacll and of the vehicle be provided, \\n= This would insure that a low spat could not occur in the line connecting \\nfront and rear packs which could collect fluid and prevent venting, Ample space \\nIs available to install the two systems, To insure saf~? venting a \\ni I \\nflame arrester is installed at the end, of the \\'vent tubes, The latest design as recommended \\nby Qlobe Is shown in FIG, 30, i \\nBattery Charging System 0 . i \\nSchematically this system would be similar to the ETV-1. The external ,- 1 \\nconnection could be behind the grill with a suitable access door provided, In addition a battery cooling system might \\nbe required, Although the batteries are located \\nwhere an optimum amount of natural air flow would occur and the supporting structure \"allows for \\n- a free flow of air around the modules, temperatures developed during charging might dictate the need for a forced air supply, No specific cooling \\nI! \\nrequirement specifications are available but requirements could probably be met with a straightforward \\nsystep as shown in FIG. 31. A plastic shroud attached to the front of the battery support cage would direct air flow from a fan over and between the batteries. The fan drive motor and \\nmounting would be similar to the reqsTte electric drive engine cooling fan used on the \\nOmni, Each fan and motor could pfobably be \\n1 smaller than the Omni depending upon the results of actual vehicle installation cooling \\n\\n\\nBAIP!l%RY PACK 7 \\nSHROUD & SUPPORT \\nI Figure 31 BATTERY COOLING SYSTEM \\nI I \\n58 -- - +- .- - \\n,i \\' p-\\\\ \\n\" -- - *a -----&*A ---, \" --.--,-*9< i---- - ---- -. -- - \\nWith respat to\\'3ahicle modiffeations to pmvide for tho iwtallation of electric \\ndrive components only minor changes are required.

However, review \\nof \\'fde brake system for the BTV-1 with Chrysler Engineering indicated that \\nno major changes were necessary. This,favorable situation resulted \\n(5 \\nfrom: o The use of a regenerative braking system in conjunction with the electric \\nmotq drive. This automatically proportioned system tuned to requirements through the microprocessor relieves the brakes of much of their work. o The rear brakes \\nare(in effect oversized on the Omni because they are the smallest currently available in large scale \\nprqduction.

This change might not 1 \\nbe required for this propogal bacausc: of the reduced weight on the 1 \\nrear wheels vs, the m\\'V-1. The brakes ara designad to oparata satisfactorily \\nin tho manual nppl.ication mo&,.since a suitable power \\n\\'i \\nsource for braking Is not available, \\nWheels must ba Increased In gage to support tho additional load, Tire load capacity \\nal~ needs to be improvd, Since only a ona size larger tire could \\nbe accotntnodatad in the wheel wells, a higher load range tire \\n4 was required, Tho BTV-1 for example uses n Pl75/75R15 extra load range I \\nLl \\nI (D equivalent) tira which is adequate for the weight of this design. Since \\nL \\ntha P175/75 tire is standard on the Omni coupe it will fit in the availabla \\n11 \\nspace of the electric vohicle. Sinca the maximum tire load is slightly less \\nttim on tho ETV-1. a lower tire pressure would ba used for this \\n- vehicle. The tnaximum load occures on thn front rather than on tha rear for tha ETV-1. Uniform \\nfrontlrear tire prcssuros could probably be used \\ni rather than the significantly diff erent values specified for the ETV-1. \\nI \\nThe steering system aan be utilized exactly as on the Omni.

Power \\n$- \\nI \\nsteering would not be available because of the lack of a sultable power source. \\n\\\\ \\nEngine mounts for the internal combustion power plant were r~moved and replaced with electric \\ndrive mounts similar to those used for the BTV-1. \\n-A \\nIn order to better demonstrate the installation of the electric components, a \\nvet~icle mock-up was constructed utilizing an Omni structure which was available st \\nPioneer from apr&hws weight analysis conducted fa the Department of Transportation. \\nTho main areas of the mock-up are shown in FIQS. 32 thru 36.

INTRODUCTION \\nPioneer Engineering and Manufacturing Company (PEN) was awarded a I \\ncontract to perform an electric vehicle design study for the Jet Propulsidn \\nLaboratory of the California Institute of Technology [JPL) . The objectives of this study \\nwere to evaluate and select electric vehicle drive system components and to package the selected components in an existing vehicle in a more nearly \\n4 optimum manner than is generally done in retrofit EV conversions. MGA Research \\nij Corporation (MGA) assisted PEM in their study by evaluating various.EV component 1 \\n1 \\n1 layouts with respect to their influence on vehicle stability and control. Under the \\nfirst task of the overall program, PEM developed a number of \\n5 \\nalternate EV component layout designs, all packaged within the confines of the \\nselectkd base car, a Chryslef Corporation Omni/Horizon. MGA then assisted in an : \\n\\'1 \\nevaluation of these designs by conducting static analyses whieh provided an i \\nii I \\nindication of the potential impact fifteen selected designs might have on ;I j \\nhandling response variations from the base car. This information, coupled with \\nb 1 other\\'design considerations, resulted in the selection of two EV configurations \\nhi i \\nthat would be expected to reflect good EV component packaging while at the same ! \\ntime maintain acceptable vehicle handling characteristics, \\nt- i \\nIt is important to recognize that vehicle handling qualities are largely i , i i \\nsubjective and qualitative in nature, and very little information exists which 1 \\nCan be appli&d to determine whether a given vehicle handles ttgoodu or ttbadpt, d \\nJ1 \\nexcept in a gross sense. Production passenger cars exhibit a wide range of \\ndynamic characteristics, and the development of \\'a vehicle requires many design compromises which include handling as one of many aspects of automotive \\n- \\nengineering which must be addressed. \\n1 I \\nWith this in mind, the evaluation of the.,,EV configuration handling , \\n0- _qualities was made by comparing predicted dynamic response characteristics h \\nwith those of the base car for identical control inputs. Thus, the impact of \\n\\'--< \\nI alternate packaging layouts on vehicle handling qualities was judged in a \\\\ \\ni relative senso based on the responses of a production vehicle which possesses i \\n\\\\\\\\ handling qualities suitable for the general public, I \\nI : i \\nC The comparative evaluations which are described in detail later in i \\nthis report were carried out with a proprietary adoptat,$on of the Highway- \\\\ \\nI Vehicle-Object Simulation Model (HYOSM), Reference 1, and were based on two 1 \\nJ: simulated manuevers, a rapid steex input to a constant level and a sinusoidal 1 \\n1 \\n( steer input, both performed at various levels .of input, The evaluations \\n< \\nI spanned the range of vehicle response from the linear regime to the limit I \\nperformance regime. Additional linear vehicle dynamics analyses were conducted \\nto expand upon the results obtained from the HVOSM simulation runs. \\n> \\nin general, tho results of this study indicated that either of the 1 \\nI \\ntwo selected EV configuratio~~s would possess handling characteristics that are 1 \\nconsistent with the ranges available within the existing vehicle population. \\nii One of the .configurations does respond to contrtil inputs in a manner more \\n(1 \\\\ \\nsimilar to the base car than does the other, however. 1 \\nf9 \\nI 4 \\'i I Tho following section discusses the major conclusions resulting from \\nthis study, A Technical Discussion is then presented describing, in some detail, the electric vehicle configurations that were analyzed and \\ntQe physical properties \\nof the vehicles that were employed in the analyses. This is followed by a discussion of linear handling theory and results obtained for the base vehicle and two \\nEV configurations. The vehicle maneuvers simulated with the HVOSM, together \\nwith the vehicle responses resulting from them are .then presented. \\n/I \\nAppendices containing a synopsis of the mathematical model used in the HVOSM, a summary of \\nthe HVOSM input data, and vehicle re$nonse plots f& \\nboth the trapezoidal and sinusoidal steer maneuvers. \\n2, CONCLUSIONS \\n0 \\nSince the primary thrust of the activity reportcd herein was with \\nregard to the cvnluetion of the likely vchicle handling quslities resulting \\nfroin various approaches toward retrofitting electric val~icle drive systom **& components into en existing internal combustion engine vehicle, our ccnclusionsl~ \\narc based primarily on a comporison of responses predicted for the base yel~icle \\nand clcctric vchiclc canfigurations. \\nCj \\n1 . \\nI Two major conclusions arise from the xcsults of this study,@ First, ,;, 1 \\nit is possible to package clcctric vehicle drive systom components in \\nChrysler Corporation hnnWIlorizon in a manner that does not significantly-degrade , \\nthe handling qualities inllcrcnt in this car. It shg~ld,\\'however, be recognized \\nthat tlm added wcight of thc EV drive systen roquirjs that careful consideration \\nbe given to basc vclliclc components and structure. Clearly, the stispensioii \\nsystem requires, at a minimum, increased spring rates in order to maintain ride \\nheight and frcqucncy cqudl to that of the basc car. l2dditional danlping and \\nstrcngtl~encd 1 suspension mcmbcrs may also be ncccssary. When carrying thc addcd ,:, 1 \\nload nssocjatcd with the EV drive systems, tho base vehicle fires arc, at best, 1 \\nmarginal in tcrms of reserve load capacity and cornering stiffness. Within the simulation \\nstudy reported in the following section, we have assumed that, \\nif actually co~rtructed, both BVls studied would have modified suspension springing \\n(sd\\'as to maintain the same fronf and xcar ride frequencies as on \\nthe base car) and have bcen Pitted with larger tires (CK70x15) I: with increased \\nload corrying capacity and lli cornering stiffness. Furthermore, no consideration \\nhks been given to tlie effect that the. addcd weight and the packaging layout might \\nhave on the crashworthiness response of the base vehicle structure. It \\nis, of course, recognized that this aspect of thc l~ypothetical conversions were not intended to \\nbc addressed by this study; nonetheless, future,effs~ts \\nmust begin to consider this vital aspect of electric vekiele safety. with The second major conclusion resulting \\nfrom this the relative ranking \\nof the two EV configurations studied \\nB study deals in depth with \\nrcspect to llandling chilractoristics. Two configurations, ilJ1t and ItNtt were \\nsclected for detailod handling analysis based on n preliminary static analysis and \\nother packaging related considerations. While, both of tllose configurations - \\nware judged to cxl~ibit response cl~erncteristics well within the &ngc obsorvod \\nin tho vehicle population, conf iguration ttN1l consis tent ly responded to control \\ninputs in s manner closer to tho basc car than did configuratio~~ \"JH. Note \\nthat the selection of tires used on the EVts would be expected to )lave a sub- stantial \\noffccr on tho absolute EV responses but givcn the same tires on both \\nUY1s, rbc rclnCIvc ranking would be expected to be the same. 4 \\n3. DXSCUSSION OF RESULTS \\nI This seetion provides a discussion of tha rasults obtained in the- \\nI \\'study. The first subsection doscribos the vehicle configurations studisd and> \\nincludes a description of soae,of the data used to nathematicnlly describe the \\nI base vehicle as well as the procadurcs employed for developing data for \\ndescribing various hypothetical electric vehicle configurations, A comparison I \\nof some fundamental vehicle charackerisrics is provided for 15 vehicle con- \\n( figurations. Following is a brief discussion of the application of linear vchic;e \\nI \\nI handling theory to the chnractorization of expected vel~iclc response behavior, \\nI The last subsection dcscribcs the application of the HVOSM computer simulation \\nI 1 to thc study of selected BV corifigurations in both the linear and non-linear \\nI I ranges of operation, t 1 \\ni \\nI An initial step in thj,s attempt toward optimization of electric vehicle component packaging \\nwas to select a base vehicle which would be a practical \\nI \\nchoice for conversion from intcrnal combustion to electric drive, This approach towards layout optimization, that of basing the study on an existing vehicle, \\nr was takeh for two reasons. First, it provided an existing vthnicle structure and * \\nperiphery within which to work rather than attempting to design a totally new vehicle package--an undertaking \\noutside the scope of the projcct. Second, \\nI \\nsince vehicle handling evaluation is largely qualitative, judgements regarding the I \\nprediction of electric vehicle handling characteristics can be best made by comparison \\nof response mctrics wit11 a known conventional vehicle. Indeed, a \\ngoal. of any electric velmicle program should be to maintain handling qualities i \\nk , close to those of conventional.v~hicles to which people are accwtomed. > \\n1: \\nI \\'4 \\n\\'f I The base vehicle selected by BEM in conjunction with JPL for use in 9 \\n1 \\nthis study was a Chryslsr Corporat,ion OmnilHorizon.

In correspondence with the general nature of the HVIS, thc tire model% \\n\\'1 used arc designed to handle a complete range of loading conditions, from a \\n1 i \\nloss of contht with the ground to a condition of extreme overload. Provision q \\nis made for up to four different sets of tire data, therefore, each tire on , i \\nthe vehicle may hav$ different characteristics at the\\'option of the user. 1 \\n1 \\nThe tiro coordinarc sysb$m employed is illustrated in Figure 4 \\nand is consistent with the SAE definitions of tire forces and rno~nents, Two \\ntire models arc available, the more detailed considering all variables illustrated \\nin Figure 4, A somewhat simplified tire model is also used when wheel spin dynamics are not significant in determining vehicle response \\n[i,e., constant speed or longitudinal steady-sthte events). In this r) \\nsimplified model, the rotational velocity of the wheels are neglected as is \\nthe, rolling resistance moment. \\n\\' The calculation of tiye force\\'s and moments begins with the determination \\nI\\\\-- r \\nof the radial force acting an the tire rcrhich is based on the geometrical inter- // \\'> ference between the undeforme\\'d tire radius and the terrain beneath the tire. This radial \\nforce j,s then transformed to the tire normal force knowing the tire \\ninclination angle and the previous value of side force. All tire calculations \\nI! :,, \"J 1 are then based on the normal fore@, ($.l.ip angle, inclination (camber) angie and wheel \\nsp?6 velocity [or torque if the simplified version is used). \\nc \\nThe tire circumferential force (tractive or braking force) is \\ncomrjuted by two methods depending on the tire model ere. For the detailed \\nk model, it is based on the,relfltive slip between the tme tread and ground \\n\\\\\\\\ (computed from the rotational velocity of the tire and the tire center linea~ \\nvelocity along the wheel heading) and an empirical fit to data in the form of circumferential force \\nas a, function of slip, speed and normal load. In the simplified tire model, \\ncircumferential force is determined by the input value of wheel torque \\nand the instantaneous rolling radius.

Thefinal report wasamore detailed \\ndiscussion ofthetectonic significance oftheCoprates region \\n(Saunders, Roth, Downs, andSchubert). \\nR.J. Phillips (LPI) compared thegravitational power \\nspectrum of_lars with that oftheEarth. Theunique long-wave- \\nlength anomaly ofthe?_ars spectrum isrelated totheTharsis \\nbulge; otherwise, theslope ofthepower-vs.-sperical-harmonic- \\nindex curve isroughly parallel tothat fortheEarth uptothe \\nmiddle harmonics forwhich ther_ars curve hasbeen determined. \\nPhillips suggested that theTharsis region maybesomewhat \\nanalogous totheNorth African gravity low--perhaps anincipi- \\nentrift (?). \\nG.F. Davies (Washington U)discussed models forthethermal \\nevolution ofMars that consider amultiplicity ofheat sources \\nandthat assume convective heat transport. Theinitial tempera- \\nture assumed istheprimary control onthetiming ofpeak heat \\nflux; core formation will exert only asecondary influence on \\nthis timing.

Solomon (MIT) andJ.W. Head (Brown) presented an \\nalternate view ofthetectonic history oftheTharsis region. \\nThey pointed outthat thetacit assumption ofsome workers \\nthat theheavily cratered materials incorporated intheTharsis \\nuplift areprimordial crust need notbetrue, butthat these \\nmaterials could just aseasily bevery oldvolcanics formed \\njust before theendofearly bombardment. Thus they argued \\nthat theentire \"uplift\" could beconstructional. Ifso,itis \\nnotnecessary topostulate unique, adhocinternal events to \\nexplain thelarge andunique crustal feature Tharsis. They \\npostulated astrictly constructional Tharsis supported bya \\nregionally thick lithosphere; alithosphere with local thin \\nspots that concentrate global stresses (and thus control frac- \\nturing) andthat also concentrate volcanic activity. Theheat \\nofvolcanism would tend topreserve thelocal thin spots inthe \\nlithosphere, favoring long-continued tectonic andvolcanic \\nactivity inthesame places. \\nD.U. Wise (UMass) summarized structural, stratigraphic, \\nandcratering evidence bearing onthetectonic evolution ofthe \\nTharsis region andMars. Thehistorical evidence points to \\nrelatively fast, unique events early inmartian history -- \\nresurfacing of1/3oftheplanet, andformation oftheTharsis \\nuplift --ahistory that does notseem consistent with models \\nbased oncontinuous operation ofthesame volcanic andtectonic \\nprocesses. These unique events canbeexplained byamodel \\nforthetectonic development of_ars that begins with planet- \\nwide convection andfoundering ofthenorthern third ofthe \\nprimordial crust; this wasfollwed bycore formation, arapid \\nevent that liberated theheat required fortheTharsis uplift \\nandthelong-lived volcanic activity. Thehighland-lowland \\nboundary acted asazone ofweakness controlling thelocation \\nofTharsis.\\nR.S. Saunders, etal.(JPL) andG.Schubert (UCLA) reported \\nonastudy ofaregion south ofCoprates Chasma that coincides \\n2\\n\\nwith thecrest oftopographic high, recently defined byEarth- \\nbased radar scans. Thehigh region isembayed bymaterials of \\nRidged Plains, soitexisted asatopographic elevation before \\ntheformation ofthese materials. There isphotogeologic \\nevidence that thelavas forming theRidged Plains have, at \\nleast inpart, come from sources onthis topographic high. Of \\neven greater interest, however, isthepresence offlatiron- \\nlike features along theflanks ofthehigh region. Byanalogy \\ntosimilar features onEarth, theauthors interpret these flat- \\nirons torepresent theupturned anderoded edges oflayers \\ndipping away from thehigh region, aninterpretation implying \\nthat theelevated region istectonic rather than constructional. \\n_IARTIAN CRATERING \\nTherole ofimpact cratering onMars wasreviewed byJ. \\n!lead (Brown). Theunique character ofmartian fluidized ejecta \\ncraters (rampart, \"splosh\" orpedestal craters) wasdiscussed \\nincontext with theinferred cratering mechanisms responsible \\nfortheproduction oflunar andterrestrial craters. Latitude, \\naltitude andtarget material were shown toinfluence martian \\ncrater morphology andtheareal extent oftheejecta deposits, \\nbuttheexact mode offormation ofthese craters remains unre- \\nsolved. Target characteristics (acombination ofpre-existing \\nparticle size, stratification andvolatile content) atthetime \\nofthecratering event were identified asthemost likely \\ncausative factor fortheproduction offluidized ejecta, but \\natmospheric effects were also considered. Detailed geological \\nmapping oflarge martian craters andtheapplication oflines \\noffuture research tohelp resolve some oftheprocesses respon- \\nsible forthestriking morphological differences bewteen martian \\ncraters andtheir lunar andmercurian counterparts. \\nTheuseofcrater size/frequency curves toderive estimates \\nforamartian chronology wasdiscussed byK.Hiller and_. \\n3\\n\\nNeukum (Ludwig-Maximilian U,W.Germany). Acompilation of \\npublished crater counts suggests that onthebasis oftheir \\ncratering curve, theproduction ofthevolcanic constructs and \\nthemajor erosion_l episodes onMars were restricted tothe \\nearly history oftheplanet. Exceptions tothis time frame \\naretherelatively recent formation (0.5 b.y.B.P.) ofthe \\nTharsis shield volcanoes andthefloor material ofchannels \\nsuch asKasei Vallis. \\nViking Lander images were employed byR.Arvidson (Wash- \\nington U)tocalculate theresurfacing history ofMars. The \\nhigh degree ofcrater preservation atVL-I suggests that rock \\nbreakdown andremoval rates aremuch less than Imm/yr. \\nCumulative crater frequency curves forparts ofthehigh \\nnorthern latitude.plains indicate that a\"bulbous terrain\" \\nmaterial isequivalent inagetotheoldest extensive plains \\nunits intheequatorial region. Dust mantling onthis unit \\nmaybeoccurring atabout imm/yr ifsuch plains materials are \\n3-4x109years old. This deposition rate issimilar to \\nthat inferred forthehigher northern plains andisnotconsi- \\ndered torequire anydrastic change inmartian climate. Arvid- \\nsonestimates from crater counts that N75% oftheplanet\\'s \\nsurface area formed between 3.5-4.0b.y. ago, which henotes \\nisinconsistent with current evolution models forMars. \\nThree papers dealt specifically with aspects ofmartian \\ncrater morphology. K.Blasius andcoworkers (PSI) outlined \\naproject designed toprovide aglobal survey ofcrater ejecta \\nmorphology, andpresented footprints forthemedium resolution \\nViking images that they intend touseastheir data base. \\nA.Woronow andP.Mutch (UA) described their measurements \\nofcrater size vs.ejecta surface area forcraters lying in \\nquads. MC-17 andMC-18. They applied avariety oftheoretical \\nmodels totheir data base toconclude that discrete crater types \\n(pedestal, lobate, andmulti-lobate) exist onMars, instead of \\nacontinuum ofejecta blanket morphologies. Distinct anddiffe- \\n4\\n\\nrent physical properties ofthetarget and/or projectile \\nwere inferred toproduce these different crater types. A \\nballistic mode ofejecta emplacement wasrejected byemploying \\nempirical aswell asobservational data. Theformation ofeach \\nejecta lobe wasattributed tointernal failure ofrimmaterial, \\nwhich wasinitiated bythemaximum thickness oftheejecta \\nexceeding theloading strength ofthe\\'material. Successive \\nepisodes offailure were proposed asapossible mechanism for \\ntheformation ofmulti-lobate crater ejecta deposits. \\nAspects ofejecta emplacement were also considered byP. \\nMouginis-Mark (Brown). Aglobal study ofcraters possessing \\nsingle (Type i)anddouble (Type 2)continuous ejecta deposits \\nrevealed that neither latitude, altitude nortarget material \\nwere solely responsible forthedistribution ofthese crater \\nL types. Adisparity ofejecta travel_ distances wasidentified \\nbutremains unexplained: Type 2eJecta deposits consistently \\ntravelled 0.8crater radii further from thecrater rimthan \\ncomparable ejecta around Type icraters. Volume estimates for \\ntheejecta andcrater cavity indicate that considerable quanti- \\nties oflocally derived material beyond thecrater mayhave to \\nbeincorporated within theejecta lobes toexplain theobserved \\nthicknesses ofthese deposits. Ries Crater wassuggested asa \\npossible terrestrial analogue forthis martian process, since \\ntheGerman crater exhibits asimilar increasing proportion of \\nlocally derived material with increasing distance from the \\nparent crater andradial scouring ofbedrock beyond therim \\ndeposits.\\nMARTIAN VOLCANISM \\nAreview ofthemajor volcanic provinces andprocesses \\ncurrently identified onMars wasably presented byRonald \\nGreely (ASU), providing aframework forsubsequent papers. \\nGreeley summarized thedistribution ofvolcanism inspace and \\n5\\n\\ntime, concluding that plateau plains aretheoldest volcanic \\nunits, thelarge shields andflood lavas surrounding them are \\ntheyoungest.\\nSmall volcanic constructional features oftheTempe \\nPlateau were discussed byCarroll AnnHodges (USGS) andJeff \\nB.Plescia (USC, JPL), both ofwhom drew analogy with low \\nshields oftheSnake River Plain. TheTempe Plateau region \\nsurveyed covers about 200,000 km2,asrepresented onViking \\nimages obtained during rev627A, frames 01through 58. The \\narea includes twomajor terrain units: anintensely fractured \\nupland plateau remnant andanembaying lowland clearly made up \\nofasequence oflava flows; thevents occur predominantly, \\nbutnotexclusively, inthelowland, andappear tobelocalized \\nalong fractures trending N50°-60 °E.Thefracture trend in \\ntheupland ispredominantly N30°-40 °E;scattered N50o-60 °E \\nfractures intheupland appear transected bytheN30o-40 °E \\nset, which isabsent from thevolcanic lowlands. \\nHodges concluded that thevents (numbering perhaps 26to \\n30)oftheTempe-Mareotis region were decidedly themost con- \\nvincing ofallthe\"lesser volcanic provinces\" thus farpostu- \\nlated; thedimensions arewithin thesame order ofmagnitude as \\nthose ofsimilar small terrestrial shields, anddimensionless \\nratios, insofar asthese canbedetermined (height/base; summit \\ncrater width/basal diameter ofshield), areessentially identi- \\ncaltothose oflowshields (Icelandic shields), andsteep \\nshields (including Mauna UluinHawaii). Fissure vents also \\nappear tooccur inthis province. \\nPlescia compiled crater statistics showing that theshields \\nandlava plains were contemporaneous, having l-km-crater densi- \\nties ofabout Ii00_35 per106km 2.These vents areolder than \\nthelarge Tharsis shields butessentially contemporane.ous with \\nthesmaller shields (Uranius Patera, Uranius Tholus, Ceraunius \\nTholus) that arealigned with thelarge shields andlocalized \\nbetween them andtheTempe area. \\n\\nAmajor problem seems tobeexplaining thetruncated \\ndevelopment ofthesmall Tempe shields andtheir occurrence \\natthefringe oftheprovince ofvery large shields. Greeley \\n(ASU) earlier raised thesame question ofdevelopment with \\nrespect totheshields oftheSmake River Plain. Hypotheses \\ntoaccount forthis type ofbasaltic eruption style must \\nconsider both martian andterrestrial geologic environments of \\nlocalization.\\nGerald Schaber (USGS) discussed theradar, visual, and \\nthermal characteristics oflava flows intheTharsis-Memnonia- \\nAmazonis region ofMars. High resolution (10-25 m/pixel) \\nViking orbiter images permit visual assessment ofEarth-based \\nradar analyses ofrmsslopes atIto30mlateral scale. \\nVariable butgenerally high rmsslopes predicted fortheTharsis- \\nMemnonia-Amazonis volcanic plains from radar data arequalita- \\ntively confirmed bytheViking image data. Among theroughest \\nplanar surfaces ontheplanet (atlateral scales ofitoseveral \\ni00m)isinsouthern Elysium Plainitia where theexistence \\nofyardangs isindicated bytheViking images. \\nThehigh resolution images also offer clues tointerpre- \\ntations ofpre-dawn temperature residuals andthethermal \\ninertia data. Thermal contacts that outline low-temperature \\nregions onHars (Tharsis-Memnonia-Amazonis, Arabia, Elysium \\nMons) apparently mark theboundaries ofstable andunstable \\neolian mantles. Surfaces with pre-dawn temperature residuals \\nbelow about -10°K orthermal inertia below about 4south and \\nwest ofArsia Mons mayhave received either acontinuous deposi- \\ntion offine-grained (i0toi00microns) material oranolder \\naccumulation ofsimilar material that somehow hasbeen stabi- \\nlized.\\nThecorrelations between Earth-based radar andmartian \\nlandforms images bytheViking orbiters were further discussed \\nbyPeter Mouginis-Mark (Brown) inapaper co-authored with \\nS.H.Zisk (Haystack) andG.H.Pettengill (MIT). Surfaces \\n\\ncharacterized byhigh rmsvalues intheradar return appear to \\nberugged orhilly units intheViking images. Theauthors \\nnoted theability ofradar sensors todistinguish lava types \\nonthebasis ofphysical properties (e.g. highly vesicular or \\nrugged surfaces) and/or thedegree towhich surfaces are \\nmantled. Theauthors contended that radar data confirm theano- \\nmalous character ofSolis Lacus (20°S, 85°W), anarea having \\nexceptionally high reflectivity andsmoothness values, andthat \\ntheobserved seasonal variations intheradar return canbe \\nexplained only bythepresence ofsmall amounts ofliquid \\nwater atthesurface ofSolis Lacus during local summer. This \\nconclusion generated considerable controversy intheensuing \\ndiscussion.\\nAlex Woronow (LPL) described small constructional features \\ninwestern Utopia Planitia according tomeasurements oftheir \\nbase ortotal ejecta areas asrelated totheareas ofthecen- \\ntral craters andconcluded that theratios between these para- \\nmeters dictated apyroclastic volcanic origin. Hedetermined \\nthat both thesize distribution andtheextensive size ofindi- \\nvidual features precluded their origin byimpact. Factoring in \\ntheeffects ofgravitational andatmospheric differences \\nbetween Mars andEarth, Worow concluded that theUtopian fea- \\ntures were most nearly analogous toterrestrial cinder cones. \\nMARTIAN ATMOSPHERE-LITHOSPHERE \\nAsummary ofprobable martian atmosphere-lithosphere \\ninteractions waspresented byJ.B. Pollack (ARC). Proposed \\nvolatile inventories ofMars, theEarth, andVenus were com- \\npared, anditwasargued that thevolatiles were probably \\nderived primarily from gases trapped inmaterial that formed \\ntheplanet. Gases captured from thesolar wind ortheprimor- \\ndial nebula subsequent toplanet formation, andgases derived \\nfrom impact ofasteroids andcomets were suggested nottobe \\n8\\n\\nprincipal sources ofvolatiles. Thedifferences involatile \\ninventories bewteen Mars, Earth, andVenus were attributed to \\nalarge pressure gradient butsmall temperature gradient inthe \\nsolar nebula aswell astodifferences intheefficiencies of \\noutgassing. Anearly epoch ofoutgassing during thefirst \\nbillion years wasproposed, followed byepisodic releases of \\njuvenile volatiles associated with major igneous events. It \\nwasargued that themartian atmospheric pressure mayhave de- \\nclined more orless monotonically with time through chemical and \\nphysical interaction with theregolith since, unlike Earth, \\nthere hasapparently been little atmosphere-crust volatile \\nrecycling. Possible effects ofperiodic obliquity-driven \\natmosphere-regolith volatile exchanges onMars were also re- \\nviewed, including channel formation, strong modulations of \\ndust storm activity, andtheformation ofpolar layered terrain. \\nR.S.Saunders, F.P.Fanale, andJ.B.Stephens (JPL) \\npresented results from andadescription oftheir Mars Atmos- \\nphere-Regolith Simulation (MARS) experiment. They reported \\nthesuccessful design, fabrication, andtesting oftheMARS \\nchamber andtheAeolian Clay (air) Classifier atmosphere- \\nregolith exchange andgaspermeation processes. They plan to \\nstudy therate atwhich CO2penetrates theregolith inresponse \\ntovariations inatmospheric pressure inorder todetermine \\nwhether ornottheregolith could buffer theatmospheric vari- \\nations inpressure onaseasonal time scale. They also intend \\ntostudy analogous processes with inert gases andH20vapor. \\nInitial testing with evacuated anddried I-i0 ummontmorillonite \\nshowed that thesystem candetect apressure wave ofN2asthe \\ngasflows through theclay under apressure difference of5 \\nmmto20mm(atthesurface oftheclay). \\nR.V.Morris (USC) andH.V.Lauer, Jr.(Lockheed Electro- \\nnics Co.) reported results from anexperiment inwhich natural \\nandsynthetic magnetite samples were exposed tounfiltered \\nUV-VIS-IR radiation ortofiltered UV,VIS, and (or) NIR \\n9\\n\\nradiation at0.8w/cm2inthenear-UV. Most irradiations were \\ncarried outinI00torr pure 02atmospheres, while some were \\ncarried outindryairorlaboratory airinaclosed circulating \\ngassystem. Depending onwhether ornotfilters were used, sam- \\npletemperatures were_80°C or_540°C, monitored with athermo- \\ncouple inintimate contact with themagnetite. Samples were \\nirradiated forupto_300 hrandthey were analyzed forpossible \\noxidation bysearching forchanges insaturation magnetization \\n(Js) with avibrating sample magnetometer. Theunfiltered \\nradiation (producing_540°C temperatures) produced measurable \\noxidation, while allbutonesample irradiated with filtered \\nlight showed nodetectable change inJs\" Since theunfiltered \\nsamples (_80°C) produced noperceptible changes inJs\\'they \\ndeduced that alloftheobserved oxidation wasprobably dueto \\nthermal oxidation rather than photooxidation. They suggested \\nthat theresults ofearlier experiments byR.L.Huguenin may \\nalso have been duetothermal oxidation, andthat there isnot \\ntheexperimental basis forinferring that UVphotostimulated \\noxidation occurs naturally onthesurface ofMars. \\nR.L.Huguenin, J.Danielson, _ndS.Clifford (UMass) \\nreported additional laboratory evidence that UVphotostimulated \\noxidation ofmagnetite should occur onHars. Incontrast to \\ntheresults ofMorris andLauer, unfiltered UV-VIS-IR illumina- \\ntion atfluxes aslowas1.7x1012 photons cm-2s-iA -Iat1950A \\nproduced oxidation after 240hrsatsample temperatures of50- \\n65°C inlaboratory air. Sample temperatures were measured using \\n(I)embedded orthinly coated (with magnetite) thermocouple \\nandthermistor probes inavariety ofconfigurations; and(2) \\naseries ofmagnetite coated and (or) embedded standardized \\nmelting point substances. Relative humidities were maintained \\nabove thecritical 1-5% level at50-54°C, which isrequired in \\norder forphotooxidation tooccur. When humidities were lower \\nthan thecritical threshold, photooxidation didnotoccur (as \\nreported intheearlier experiments). This might account for \\ni0\\n\\ntheresults ofMorris andLauer, whoused dryatmospheres. \\nHumidity isnotrequired foroxidation ofmagnetite at \\nT=580°C, which isalso consistent with theresults ofMorris \\nandLauer. Huguenin etalalso reported experimental confirma- \\ntion that UVillumination produces photoemission from magnetite \\nwith awork function of3.9_.ieVandaquantum yield of \\n0.i-Iat1950_ in10-6torr 02,aspredicted bytheearlier \\nphotooxidation experiments. Also reported wasanerror in \\ntheearlier UVflux estimates, which indicates that photooxida- \\ntion maybeoccurring byafactor of103faster onMars than \\npreviously estimated. Itwassuggested that therate isproba- \\nblyseverely inhibited bysurface coatings, however, andthat \\nfreshly abraded rock surfaces mayform surface coatings ona \\nmuch faster time scale than previously estimated. \\nS.D.Wall (JPL) reported theobservation ofawhite sur- \\nface condensate attheViking 2lander site during both ofits \\ntwowinters. Ineach case thecondensate appeared near L= s\\n235°andremained forapproximately 200sols. Dust storms over \\nthelander accompanied theappearance both years. Data acquired \\nincluded photometric function, spectral albedo, temperature \\nandpressure. AC02(s) composition wasindicated, butH20(s) \\nmayberequired toexplain theslow removal period. Thickness \\nofthecondensate could notbeaccurately measured butitwas \\nbounded by_i_matthelowendand_Immatthehigh end. \\nS.M.Clifford andR.L.Huguenin (UMass) discussed the \\nH20mass balance onMars andproposed that aglobal subperma- \\nfrost groundwater flow system maybeindicated. Annual polar \\ndeposition rates (poleward of60°N)andequatorial evaporation/ \\noutgassing rates areboth apparently _i015 g/yr. Ifthese rates \\naretypical ofthemartian norm, anamount ofH20equivalent \\ntothat believed tobecontained intheNorth Polar Capwould \\naccumulate inless than 105years andtheentire theoretical \\nglobal inventory ofH20onMars could becold-trapped atthe \\npoles in107years. Since such accumulations have notbeen \\nii\\n\\nobserved andsince enough time haselapsed forthis process to \\nhave been repeated several hundred times, itwasproposed that \\nsome efficient means forremoval ofH20from thepoles and \\nreplenishment ofequatorial regolith H20probably exists. \\nPurely atmospheric models ofreplenishment (preferential \\nadsorption andburial ofcondensates) were reviewed andthey \\nappear tobetooinefficient. Itwasproposed that thedeposi- \\ntion ofatmospheric H20inthepolar regions maybebalanced \\nbytherelease ofgeothermally melted H20from thebase of \\nthecapinto aglobal interconnected groundwater flow system \\nbeneath themartian permafrost. Evaporation ofbrines andice \\nfrom thetopofthepermafrost atequatorial andmidlatitudes \\ncould then bebalanced bytheflow ofsubpermafrost melt water \\ninto these regions, completing thecycle. They proposed that \\nthecycle maynotbecontinual onashort term; instead the \\nsystem mayperiodically discharge andrecharge inresponse to \\nclimatic variations. \\nMARTIAN CHANNELS \\nAsummary talk byM.H.Carr (USGS) stressed thegreat \\nimprovement inresolution ofchannel detail acquired during the \\nViking missions. Therecognition ofwidespread small channels \\nofapparently quite oldageistaken toindicate adistinctly \\ndifferent climate inearly Martian time. These small channels \\nprobably played asignificant role intheexchange ofwater \\nbetween theMartian regolith andatmosphere. Arange ofpro- \\nposed mechanisms were responsible fordifferent channels. \\nCriteria diagnostic ofvarious mechanisms should befurther \\ndeveloped.\\nD.E.Thompson (JPL) found that recent theoretical analysis \\nontheflow stability anderosion bydebris flows hadpointed to \\ntheneed forbetter understanding ofsediment transport mecha- \\nnisms incatastrophic floods, especially interms oftheforma- \\nl2\\n\\ntion ofspecific enchannel fluvial features. Thompson has \\ninitiated afield program intwoareas ofcatastrophic flooding \\nintheSt.Elias Mountains, Yukon. Here, glaciers periodically \\ndammajor rivers. Theresulting lakes aredrained either by \\ntunneling under theiceorbreaking theicedam. Thefeatures \\nformed during theflooding areanalogous tothose intheChan- \\nneled Scabland andinselected outflow channels onMars. \\nBedform profiling andgravel size analysis arecarried out \\ninthefield. Size-dependent sediment transport models arethen \\ndeveloped topredict theobserved profiles andgrain sizes. \\nThese models arecreated both interms ofkinematic wave re- \\nsponse ofdune height toinstantaneous changes indischarge, and \\ninterms ofshock propagation ofchanges influid rheology, and \\nhence erosion potential, duetohyper-concentration ofdebris \\nduring flooding. \\nH.Masursky (USGS) reported onrecent progress indetermi- \\nnation ofcrater-frequency ages ofthesequence ofevents that \\nlead totheformation ofthelarge channels which flow into \\nChryse Planitia. Thecreater frequencies confirm anextended \\nhistory ofwater flow inthechannels. Thelack ofresolvable \\nshorelines suggest that theindividual flood events were widely \\nseparated intime andthat noaccumulation ofponded water \\noccurred.\\nD.Pieri, M.Malin andJ.Laity (JPL) reported onfurther \\nanalysis andclassification ofthesmall channels orvalley- \\nsystems. They have found that themorphologic heterogeneity of \\nthesmall channels isatleast asgreat asthat ofthelarge \\nchannels previously classified bySharp andMalin. They have \\ndeveloped aclassification scheme consisting ofseven network \\npatterns. Notably, inspite ofthecommon reference tothis \\nchannel as\"dendritic\", none ofthesystems display dendritic \\nnetwork patterns. \\nAvailable qualitative andquantitive evidence, gathered by \\nasurvey ofmartian valleys both from theMariner 9andViking \\n13\\n\\nOrbiter data sets, seems todiscount thehypothesis ofa \\nrainfall origin. Instead, thedata seem tofavor anorigin \\nthrough groundwater orgroundice (sublimative) sapping. \\nThis hypothesis byPieri andco-workers is,ifverified, \\nquite significant. Ithaspreviously been suggested that the \\nsmall channels reflect theinitial process ofacquifer recharge. \\nIf,ontheother hand, thechannels reflect groundwater sapping \\nthen there must have been anearlier event ofrecharge; and \\nevent with one, asofyet, unrecognized morphological imprint. \\nD.Nummedal (LSU) presented adebris flow-debris avalanche \\nmodel toaccount forthedown-channel changes inmorphology of \\nthelarge channels ofthesouthern Chryse Basin. Themodel \\ncalls forinitial liquefaction andcollapse ofunstable volcano- \\nclastic sediments within thechaotic terrains followed bya \\nslow pseudolaminar flow ofdebris outofthechaos. Byprogres- \\nsive viscosity decrease this debris canbeaccelerated into a \\ncatastrophic turbulent debris-avalanche atthechannel debouch- \\nment area. This down channel transformation offluid properties \\nisconsistent with observed changes inchannel morphology. \\nStable islands near thechannel source areevidence oflaminar \\nshear flow, whereas streamlined remnants inthedebouchment area \\nsuggests theaction ofaviolent turbulent flow. \\nMARTIAN POLAR ANDPERIGLACIAL PROCESSES \\nB.K.Lucchitta (USGS) reviewed thestatus ofinvestiga- \\ntions into Martian periglacial features. Various types of \\npatterned ground andtheir relationship topossible freeze-thaw \\nphenomena were discussed. Anewhypothesis waspresented onthe \\norigin ofoutflow channels, namely that these features were \\nproduced byglacial scour. Lucchitta also suggested that the \\ncircumferential ridges ontheflanks ofArsia Mons andother \\nTharsis shield volcanoes might also beofglacial origin. These \\nunusual ridge structures arenotdeflected bypre-existing \\n14\\n\\ntopography inthewaythat theterminal ridges ofejecta flows \\nandland slide tongues have been deviated bycrater rims. \\nLucchitta suggests that moraine-like debris accumulations were \\nlowered down onthesubjacent terrain astheiceablated. \\nM.C.Malin (ASU) described studies ofthesapping process \\nusing theEarth asananalog forfeatures onMars. Sapping, \\ntheheadward erosion byundermining ofbasal support andsub- \\nsequent collapse, hasbeen invoked asonepossible mechanism \\nformation ofvalleys andcanyons onMars. Therole ofmultiple \\nprocesses ofweathering andtransport informing these features \\nonMars wasstressed. Malin hasstudied sapping processes in \\nthefield inUtah (Navajo andWingate sandstones) andIceland \\n(hydroclastic moberg deposits andbasaltic tephra) with the \\nobjective ofdeveloping amore detailed understanding ofsap- \\nping, andhasrecognized theimportance ofwall mass movements \\nrelated toexfoliation. \\nInapaper that wasnotpresented atthemeeting, H. \\nMasursky (USGS) reported onresearch into theinventory of \\npermanent polar iceinthenorth polar region. Preliminary \\nphotogrammetric measurements ofthetopography ofthenorth \\npolar region andanewmapoftheextent ofperennial icehave \\nbeen compiled. These measurements areinterpreted toimply a \\npolar icethickness of2.2kmandavolume of2x106km3. \\nAdditional work isplanned inorder torefine these estimates. \\nA.D.Howard (UVA) described thestatus ofhisinvestiga- \\ntions into thepolar layered deposits. Twoareas ofinvesti- \\ngation arebeing stressed: thedetailed description ofthe \\ngeometrical relationships oflayered slopes andperennial ice \\nthroughout thepolar region, anddetailed descriptions oflimited \\nareas using photoclinometric techniques. \\nJ.A.Cutts (PSI) described thesimulation ofsequences \\noflayered strata inthepolar region. Polar layered thick- \\nnesses arerelated toglobal dust storms occurrences, which is \\nassumed tobecontrolled bylong-term climate variation. The \\n15\\n\\nclimate variations arerelated tolong-term quasiperiodic \\nvariations intheorbital eccentricity andaxial obliquity of \\nMars. Preliminary results suggest that obliquity control of \\ndust storm occurrence results inregularly spaced layers. \\nMore detailed modelling efforts inwhich thephysical processes \\ninvolved inpolar layer formation were investigated indepth \\nwere briefly referred to. \\nJ.E.Guest (ULondon) described work ontheorigin of \\ntheNixolympica aureole. Theaureole isconsidered tobea \\nmassive slide feature which separated from theNixOlympica \\nscarp. Measurements ofthevolumes ofmaterial intheaureole \\nandcomparison with thematerial lost from thescarp arepermis- \\nsive ofthis model. \\nMARTIAN EOLIAN PROCESSES ANDLANDFORMS \\nJ.F.McCauley (USGS) gave areview ofthe\"typical\" \\neolian landforms ofMars (dunes, yardangs, and\"streaks\") and \\ntheequatorward surficial wind circulation shown bymost of \\nthese landforms. Twooutstanding problems inmartian eolian \\ngeology arethenature ofthepitted rocks atboth Viking lander \\nsites andthesource forthe\"sand\" in-the north polar erg. \\nFrom hisfield andlaboratory works, McCauley considers that \\nmany oftherocks visible atthesurface maynotbevesicular \\nspecimens, butinstead maybe originally massive rocks now \\nseverely pitted bywind erosion. Asforthesand source forthe \\ndune field near thenorth pole, rivers asonEarth mayhave \\nmade available substantial amounts ofsediment forwind trans- \\nport. IntheMars case, north-flowing rivers from theequato- \\nrial canyons andthenortherly fretted terrain mayhave de- \\nbouched inthemid- andhigh-latitude regions, providing sedi- \\nment toanactive wind regime. \\nPeter Thomas andJoseph Veverka (Cornell) continue their \\nwork onmartian streaks. Oneoftheir newideas isthat many \\n16\\n\\nregions onMars arekept free ofdust deposition byactively \\nsaltating particles, both indunes andsand sheets. This \\nimplies that, although significant sand-moving winds have not \\nbeen recorded bythelanders, norhave sand particles orchanges \\ninwind features been observed, many regions ofMars experience \\nactive eolian deposition anderosion ofsandsized sediment. \\nThomas andVeverka also observe that strong katabatic \\nwinds occur ontheTharsis volcanoes. Dust onthevolcanoes \\ncanbemoved during most seasons byslope winds. \\nE.C.Morris (USGS) hasbeen studying theTharsis region \\nandconsiders much oftheOlympus Mons aureole tobewind- \\neroded rocks, probably ignimbrite deposits. Hereported on \\ntwelve dark, irregularly shaped patches occurring inastraight \\nline inpart oftheaureole. Morris considers these patches to \\nbeduetofluids orgasses from subsurface deposits. Thefluids \\norgasses probably would bevolcanic inorigin andperhaps \\n(iffluids) enriched iniron andsulfur minerals. Furthermore, \\nbecause thepatches formed onsome oftheyoungest surface \\nunits, they maybevery recent features. \\nC.S.Breed, A.W.Ward, J.F.McCauley, N.Witbeck, and \\nM.Weisman (USGS) presented aprogress report ontheAtlas of \\nMartian Eolian Features, duetobepublished during 1980. \\nTheatlas isdesigned asa\"user\\'s guide\" tomartian eolian \\nlandforms andcontains photographs offeatures such asdunes, \\nyardangs, sand sheets, anddeflation hollows, plus quadrangle \\nmaps showing thedistributions, orientations, andvariabilities \\nofthewind features. Much ofthework will betaken from the \\nPh.D. thesis ofWard (1978) andthemaps will bedigitized and \\nplaced intheMars Data Bank. \\n\"Zig-zag\" dunes onMars andEarth were discussed byR.S. \\nU.Smith (UHouston). Zig-zag (irregular) transverse dunes are \\ncommon inthenorth-polar ergonMars, butuncommon onEarth. \\nThemartian dunes aremade ofnearly straight segments joined \\natacute angles into transverse ridges. Similar (but smaller) \\nI?\\n\\ndunes occur innorthern Death Valley, California. There, winds \\narechannelled along thevalley yetreverse seasonally, yielding \\nlittle netmigration ofthedunes. Ifthis terrestrial example \\nisavalid indicator, balanced, reversing wind regimes may \\nexist onMars. \\nTwopapers were presented ondunes andtopographic ob- \\nstacles that control them. Thefirst, byH.Tsoar andR. \\nGreeley (ASU), reports onafewmartian examples, laboratory \\nmodeling, andfield studies. Their work isconcerned with \\n\"echo\" dunes, dunes that areformed partly bywinds bouncing \\noffdownwind obstacles, andlocally flowing upwind. OnMars, \\nmany dune fields occur within craters. Many ofthese intra- \\ncrater dune fields have deep moats ortroughs between the \\nperiferal dunes andtheinterior crater wall. Tsoar andGreeley \\nconsider that theposition ofthetrough around thefield may \\nindicate thelast strong wind direction, which maynotbe \\nrecorded bydune orientation. \\nC.K.McCauley andW.J.Breed (Huseum NA)reported on \\nclimbing dunes innorthern Arizona. Their study isofbarchan \\ndunes reaching anescarpment, theresultant echo effect, and \\nportions ofthedunes elongating tobecome linear dunes that \\ncanmigrate upthenotches inthecliff faces. They have in- \\nstalled meteorological equipment andhave sampled thedunes. \\nFuture tasks include installing traps tomeasure sand flow. \\nMARS GENERAL \\nThe1:15,000,000 scale Mars geologic mapwashighlighted \\nbyD.H.Scott (USGS). Geologic mapping at1:15 million scale \\ninthewestern equatorial region ofMars shows thestratigra- \\nphic succession ofmany different rock types, including 20 \\nvolcanic flows within theTharsis volcanic province. Major \\nvolcanic andtectonic episodes arecorrelated with thestrati- \\ngraphic units andtheabsolute ages ofthese events estimated \\n19\\n\\nusing twotime-crater frequency distribution models. Relations \\nbetween geologic units andremote sensing data such asinfrared \\nthermal maps, color variations, andgravity anomalies arebeing \\nstudied. This newgeologic mapofMars made from Viking images \\ncould bethesingle most detailed source ofgeologic information \\nabout theplanet until future missions areaccomplished. \\nL.Albee (JPL) discussed theFuture ofMars Exploration \\ninthecontext ofpresent financial constraints. Part ofthis \\nfuture includes thecontinuing Viking Orbiter andViking Lander \\nmissions. Viking Lander Iwill besupported aslong asthe \\nspacecraft isoperational. Earthbased observations -telescopic \\nandradar -will increasingly become animportant tool inthe \\ncontinued studies oftheplanet Mars. \\nTheongoing Viking Lander missions waspresented byK.L. \\nJones (JPL). VL-2 hasacquired awealth ofdata during its \\nsecond complete Mars year including observations ofanaddi- \\ntional dust layer andarepeat performance ofacondensate \\naccumulation. VL-I observed anewsmall-scale landslide slump. \\nTherepeatability oftheyear-to-year observations suggests \\nthat wehave observed \"typical\" mars years. However, thedust \\naccumulation seen atboth sites requires that with observable \\nfrequency (i0years), thelanding sites areswept with winds \\nofsufficient strength toremove this thin dust layer. VL-2 \\nwill return itsfinal data inlate spring, 1980. VL-I continues \\ntooperate anddata return iscurrently planned through 1990. \\nNancy Evans (JPL) discussed theongoing Viking Orbiter \\nSurvey Mission. Medium resolution mosaics ofextensive regions \\nintheancient cratered terrain reveal numerous fascinating \\nland-forms, many ofwhich invite avariety ofinterpretations. \\nMs.Evans unrolled animpressive mosaic ofSurvey Mission images \\nthat testified totheimportance ofcontinuing theimaging \\nmission aslong astheorbiter remained functional. Cataloging \\nandmosaicking ofSurvey Mission images iscontinuing but \\npossibly will beextended over thenext fewyears. \\n19\\n\\nR.W.Wolfe (NASM) described amethod ofapplying optical \\npower spectrum analysis techniques toMars terrains. These \\ntechniques areaquantitative tool that canbeused toclassify \\nvarious terrain types andobtain information useful tophoto- \\ngeologists.\\nS.Liebes andE.C.Levinthal (Stanford) reported ontheir \\naccomplishments andprospects using Viking Lander Interactive \\nComputerized Video Stereophotogrammetry. They areproducing a \\nvariety ofdata products ranging from detailed studies of \\nspecific features (sampler arm, trenches, etc.) tosystematic \\ncontour andprofile coverage ofthearea outtoi00meters \\nfrom each spacecraft. Specific products include contour map \\nsheets inavariety ofscales appropriate tothedistance from \\neach lander. Additionally described were amultitude ofimaging \\nphotoproducts derived from high-resolution imaging mosaics. \\nThese include 8\"xi0\"photoproducts, 42\"x42\"lithograph \\nsheets, stereoscopic imaging pairs, andother geometric trans- \\nformations.\\nD.W.G.Arthur (USGS) discussed theability tomeasure \\nMars topographic relative altitudes using shadow measurements. \\nHowever, instead oftheusual measurements ofshadow length by \\npixel counts, itispossible tousearelative photometric \\ndetermination onshadows ofless than 2pixels width. This \\nmethod isinfluenced byatmospheric conditions andnearby area \\nofknown photometric properties isrequired. This method has \\nproven effective inmeasuring therelative height ofafew \\nmeters.\\nR.M.Batson (USGS) outlined thecontinuing Mars Cartogra- \\nphic Program. TheMars 1:15 million mapandtheChryse Basin \\nmaparebehind schedule, butprogress isnowwell underway and \\nnoadditional problems anticipated. Revision oftheikm \\nplanetwide contour maponthe1:150,000,000 base will becomple- \\nted, aswell assix1:5,000,000 airbrush maps will becompleted \\nbyOctober 1980.

Ifthe \\nphysical properties ofcomet nuclei aresimilar tothose of \\nH20snow, then significant quantities ofmeteoroid debris \\ncould beabsorbed bythenucleus ofashort period comet during \\nitspassage through theasteroid belt. Numerous experiments \\ndesigned tostudy thephenomenology offragment impact into snow \\nhave been performed, revealing that little lateral excavation \\noccurs, with theprojectile ultimately located atornear the \\napex oftheCrater. Ascometary devolatilization continues, \\nthis asteroidal debris would beconcentrated intheoutermost \\nlayers ofthenucleus. Continued lowvelocity impacts into a \\nregolith covered comet nucleus could produce shock lithifica- \\ntion ofthevariegated target, producing polymict breccias. \\nReflectance spectra ofsuch bodies might becomplex, andstill- \\nactive comets might eject polymict breccia fragments into Earth- \\ncrossing orbits during bursts ofdevolatilization. \\nF.Whipple andZ.Sekanina (SIAO) reported onthepreces- \\nsion ofthespin axis andapparent sublimation ofComet Encke \\nfrom observations made during 59perihelion passages over the \\npast 200years. Thedata suggest that therotation axis was \\nessentially fixed forhundreds ofrevolutions before 1700 A.D., \\nbutthecalculated spin axis moved more than I00°inlongitude \\nandalmost 30°inlatitude between 1786 and1977. Thetenta- \\ntive rotation period about 1900 A.D. was6h33mandthepossi- \\nblespinup rate issome 21minutes percentury. Therequired \\n21\\n\\nmass loss bysublimation isabout 0.09 percent perrevolution, \\nandthemass andoblateness ofthenucleus areestimated at \\n1016 grams andless than 4percent, respectively. \\nThesearch forplanet-crossing asteroids bytheteam of \\nE.Shoemaker andE.Helin (CIT) hascontinued with thePalomar \\n122cmSchmidt camera. Preliminary studies ofeight plates \\ntaken during November 1978 revealed position data foratotal \\nof232asteroids. Neworbits were calculated for145asteroids \\nbased onthe25dayarcs, andtheir apparent visual magnitudes \\nwere intherange of15to21. Although 13asteroids were con- \\nsidered tobepossible Mars crossers, only 2objects could be \\npositively identified tocross Mars orbit. About ipercent of \\nthenewasteroids found aremembers oftheEROS family, about \\n4percent aremembers oftheCoronis family and5percent are \\nmembers oftheThemis family. \\nDonald Davis, etal.(PSI andLPI), described dynamical \\nstudies pertinent togroove origin onPhobos, together with the \\nunusual ejecta trajectories calculated forthedynamical \\nenvironment that exists onPhobos. Previous hypotheses proposed \\ntoaccount forthePhobos grooves include (a)tidal stresses \\nduetoMars, (b)aerodynamic drag stress during capture of \\nPhobos, (c)fractures from theStickney crater forming event \\nand (d)secondary cratering chains. While these hypotheses \\nmayexplain some groove features, itappears necessary toseek \\nother mechanisms tounderstand allgroove orientations. A \\nrecent model byS.Weidenschilling proposed amodification of \\ntheimpact hypothesis forgroove origin. Inthis scenario the \\nStickney impact broke thesynchronous rotational lock and \\nstarted Phobos rotating about arandon axis. Thenon-synchro- \\nnous rotation coupled with Phobos\\' irregular shape, generated \\nvarying tidal stresses that eventually produced grooves. This \\nmodel assumes that material weakened byfracturing from \\nStickney yielded along planes ofmaximum shear stress which \\nwere controlled bytheshape ofPhobos. Most stickney ejecta \\n22\\n\\nwould have been deposited over thesurface, either bydirect \\nballistic emplacement orbyrecapture from circum-Mars orbit, \\nlong before thenon-synchronous rotation ofPhobos wasdamped \\nout. Hence, grooves could have been formed orregenerated \\nsubsequent toblanketing byStickney ejecta. Theunusual \\ndynamical environment ofPhobos causes variation inejecta \\nescape speed with surface location anddirection offragment \\ntrajectories, resulting inhighly asymmetric ejecta distribution \\npatterns.\\nVolcanic eruptions onIowere described byR.Strom (UA). \\nNine volcanic eruption plumes were observed over aperiod of \\n61/2days during theVoyager Iflyby. Four months later, \\nduring theVoyager IIencounter, atleast 7ofthese plumes \\nwere still active atabout thesame intensities. Thelargest \\nplume viewed byVoyager I,280kmhigh and1,000 kmwide, was \\nnotactive during thesecond encounter. During thefirst \\nencounter Plume 2consisted oftwocomponents: alarge diffuse \\ncloud about 210kmhigh emanating from thewest endofa175km \\nlong black strip andasmaller plume less than 40kmhigh asso- \\nciation with theeast end. During thesecond encounter the \\nsmaller plume hadabout doubled insize. Amajor eruption \\noccurred at340°longitude and45°Nlatitude sometime between \\nthetwoencounters anddeposited anejecta blanket comparable \\ninsize tothat associated with Plume 2.This neweruption is \\nassociated with an80kmdiameter caldera andproduced major \\nchanges insurface markings first seen byVoyager i.Several \\nother changes insurface markings occurred between thetwo \\nencounters inother areas. Most plumes arestronger inscatter- \\ningsunlight forward then backward, indicating they consist \\nofvery small particles. Thegeometry andsource regions of \\ntheplumes suggest they areassociated with both long fissues \\nandpipe vent eruptions. Allactive plumes andthesites of \\nthelarger recent eruptions areconcentrated within 45°ofthe \\nequator, butaremore orless randomly distributed inlongitude. \\n23\\n\\nThesixeruptions that have continued atahigh level of \\nactivity formore than four months indicate that atleast in \\nthese cases, large reservoirs ofvolatiles (e.g. SO2)are \\navailable tosustain thecontinuous violent eruptions. \\nAmalthea wasdescribed byJ.Veverka (C0rnell) asadark, \\nirregular satellite about 270kmlong by160kmacross. This \\nwasinferred from analysis ofVoyager imaging data with resolu- \\ntions asgood as8km/line pair. Thesatellite islocked in \\nsynchronous rotation of12hours period, with thelongest axis \\npointing toward Jupiter. Amalthea\\'s normal reflectance is \\nabout 5percent andspectrally very red. Several albedo mark+ \\nings, 20-30 kmacross, aretwice asbright (i0%) andless red. \\nAfewlarge apparent craters arevisible inthebest images, \\n7 ranging from about 50to90kmindiameter_. _ \\nS.Squyres (Cornell) andE.Shoemaker (USGS) reported \\nonpossible volume changes onGanymede andtheorigin of \\ngrooved terrain. Thegeological relationships ofgrooved \\nterrain onGanymede suggest origin from extensional tectonism, \\nindicating aperiod ofglobal expansion. Noconvincing evidence \\nofmajor zones ofcompressional deformation hasbeen recognized. \\nCrater densities onthegrooved terrain indicate that most of \\ntheexpansion took place near theendofheavy bombardment, \\nprobably intherange of4.0to3.5b.y. ago. Internal melting \\nanddifferentiation ofGanymede could have ledtoasubstantial \\nsurface area increase while refreezing ofaliquid water mantle \\nwould notcause asignificant surface area charge. \\nPLANETARY CRATERING, TECTONISM, ANDVOLCANISM \\nThis session inareal sense typifies thebreadth of \\ntopics andapproaches within planetary geology: interplanetary \\ncomparisons, field studies ofterrestrial analogs, laboratory \\nsimulations andtheoretical models. \\nR.J.Pike, D.J.Roddy andD.W.G.Arthur (USGS) reported \\n24\\n\\nresults ofcrater morphology comparisons between planets, \\nexamined with theintent todiscriminate between targetstrength \\nandeffects ofgravitational acceleration. They noted both \\naspects influence theshape ofcraters ontheterrestrial plan- \\nets, andshowed that crater morphology ontheGalilean satel- \\nlites Ganymede andCallisto were consistent with \"soft\"_target \\nmaterials. They also presented aphotogrammetrically-derived \\nmartian fresh crater depth/diameter relation. \\nTheprimary purpose offracture analysis istodetermine \\nthestresses that have effected therocks under study. Insuch \\nanalyses, itisimportant todemonstrate that theorientations \\noffractures areindigenous totherocks inwhich they occur. \\nGeorge McGill (UMass) reported preliminary results from astudy \\nwithin theGrand Canyon which indicate that overlying rocks \\nhave notinherited jointing sets orother fractures from under- \\nlying materials. Henoted that inthesame region major faults \\nandfault systems have been reactivated, sothere isaScale- \\ndependent quality toinheritance that must befactored into \\nfracture analyses. \\nM.Womer (ASU) presented first results ofascale-model \\nsimulation experiment oflava flows done collaboratively with \\nR.Greeley (ASU), J.D.Iverson (lowa State), andJ.Kremer \\n(UTAustin). Hedescribed theformulization oftheir experi- \\nments using theBuckingham PiTheorem toderive dimensionless \\nparameters toaddress theinertial, viscous, andthermal \\nproperties ofthemodel, andtocompare these parameters with \\nsimilar values fornatural lava flows. Qualitatively, there- \\nsults oftheexperiments appear reasonable. Much more work \\nneeds tobeperformed tocheck thequantitative accuracy of \\nthemodel.\\nW.E.Elston, J.C.Aubele, L.S.Crumpler, andD.B. \\nEppler (UNM) examined thenature anddistribution ofcalc- \\nalkalic rocks over theEarth inthehope offinding apattern \\nfortheir occurrence that might lead toanunderstanding of \\n25\\n\\ntheir potential occurrence onother planets. Calc-alkalic \\nrocks arenotunique toanyoneterrestrial tectonic regime, \\nalthough they areespecially abundant atconvergent plate mar- \\ngins. Theabsence ofconvergent plate margins onother planets \\n(especially Mars) does notpreclude theoccurrence there of \\ncalc-alkalic rocks, since terrestrial examples areknown from \\nregions ofextensional tectonics, such astheBasin andRange \\nprovince, RioGrande rift, andColorado Plateau. \\nJ.L.Whitford-Stark (Brown) raised acautionary voice to \\nstudies aimed atdetermining magma composition from volcanic \\nlandforms. Hepresented many terrestrial examples offeatures \\nthat didnotprove diagnostic ofcomposition owing tomany \\nvariables, including eruption mechanisms andpost-eruption \\nenvironmental modification. \\nImpact heating ofH20icetargets wasexamined byM.J. \\nCintala, J.W.Head, andE.M.Parmentier (Brown). Four impor- \\ntant findings oftheir work were: (I)impacts into H20ice \\ntargets; (2)silicate clasts inalarge H20impact melt sheet \\nwill settle efficiently owing totheir higher densities -this \\nwould aidindifferentiating thecrustal materials ofice-rich \\nbodies; (3)secondary projectiles onicybodies will probably \\nbeinvarious stages offusion during ejection andflight, \\nleading tovariations insecondary cratering phenomena; and \\n(4)large quantities ofimpact melt inH20targets maylead to \\nthesubmergence ofinterior features, leading todifficulties \\nininterpreting crater morphology. \\nR.Greeley (ASU) reported onimpact experiments into vis- \\ncous targets performed incollaboration with D.E.Gault (Mur- \\nphys Center), D.B.Snyder (ASU), V.Sisson (Princeton), P.H. \\nSchultz (LPI), andJ.E.Guest (ULondon). Although notadvo- \\ncating that these scale models were completely analogous to \\nfeatures seen onMars andtheicyGalilean satellites, aspects \\noftheexperiments warranted attention. Inparticular, crater \\nmorphology appeared tobedependent more ontarget properties \\n26\\n\\nthan onage; in3/4oftheexperiments thepost-impact viscosi- \\nties were significantly decreased andsubsequent flow greatly \\nmodified thecraters. Intheexperiment, anoscillating central \\npeak produced multiple flow lobes, andthis \"peak\" could \\n\"freeze\" inanyposition, producing acentral peak, flat floor \\norcentral pit. \\nMOON ANDMERCURY \\nRecent studies oftheMoon andMercury concerned lunar \\nbasin structure, crater densities onthelunar farside andthe \\norigin ofplains units onMercury. Theorigin ofstructures \\nassociated with basins isstill controversial, andvery little \\nisknown about thecrater distribution onthelunar farside \\nanditsimplications fortheevolution ofhighlands. Mercurian \\nplains units (smooth andintercrater) comprise themost wide- \\nspread surface terrain, andthedetermination oftheir origin \\niscrucial tounderstanding both thegeologic andthermal evolu- \\ntion ofMercury. \\nD.Wilhelms (USGS, Menlo Park) presented evidence that \\nbasins 570kmdiameter, e.g., Hertzsprung andHumboldtianum, \\ndisplay interior irregularities that suggest forceful uplift \\norigins over other mechanisms proposed forring origin. However, \\noscillatory uplift also maybepossible. Outer rings arealso \\nirregular, e.g., Imbrium andCrisium, suggesting differential \\nexterior deformation andexcavation. Well observed ejecta \\nblankets areasymmetric which suggests that theimpacts were ob- \\nlique andmost basin ejecta wasejected atshallow angles. \\nThis probably results from shallow energy release, which may \\ngreatly affect basin structure, butlayering ofthetarget \\nmaterial isprobably animportant variable. \\nC.A.Wood andA.W.Gifford (NASM) have studied theareal \\ndistribution ofcraters _25kmdiameter within 20°x20° \\nsquares onthelunar farside. They have also devised arelative \\n27\\n\\nageindex bydividing thenumber ofyoung (Copernican and \\nEratosthenian) andintermediate (Imbrian) agecraters bythe \\nnumber ofancient (Nectarian andPre-Nectarian) craters. \\nAbout two-thirds ofthemapped area ofthelunar farside have \\nvalues _iindicating these areas have notbeen resurfaced \\nrecently orextensively enough toeliminate significant numbers \\nofoldcraters. About 37%ofthemapped area have values 0.5 \\nindicating these surfaces aretheoldest andleast altered by \\nvolcanism andejecta deposition. Values _Iareprimarily \\nassociated with basins. This suggests that many crater density \\nvariations canbeexplained bycrater destruction near impact \\nbasins andthat even oldbasins such asSouth Polar-Aitken basin \\npreserve crater density anomalies long after rimmorphology \\nissubdued. Onearea inthenorth-central part ofthemapped \\narea shows acrater density andrelative ageanomaly notasso- \\nciated with abasin, suggesting processes other than those \\nrelated tobasins were responsible forobliterating large \\nnumbers ofoldcraters. \\nThesmooth plains within andsurrounding theCaloris basin \\nonMercury have been atttributed toeither volcanism orbasin \\nejecta deposition. J.A.Watkins (UA) studied thedistribution \\nofcrater density anddiameter-frequency distributions asa \\nfunction ofcrater degrational type onthesmooth plains and \\nvarious Caloris impact-related terrains inorder todetermine \\nthechronology ofthese geologic units. Theareal density and \\nstatistical uncertainty were calculated for5°x5°cells on \\nthese surface units. After applying rigorous statistical tests \\ntothedata, Watkins finds that theCaloris impact-related \\nterrains allhave thesame relative age, butthat thesmooth \\nplains units older than Caloris-related terrain arelocated \\nfarthest away from thebasin. These areal crater density var- \\niations suggest that thesmooth plains were emplaced infour \\nmajor stages attheendoftheperiod ofheavy bombardment, \\nandthat because oftheagedifferences between smooth plains \\n28\\n\\nandCaloris impact-related terrain, thesmooth plains arelarge- \\nlyvolcanic deposits. \\nTwo studies ofplains units inthemercurian highlands \\nwere reported on.Geologic mapping oftheKuiper Quadrangle by \\nR.A.DeHon (NLU), D.H.Scott (USGS), andJ.R.Underwood (KSU) \\nshow that over 27%oftheQuadrangle iscovered byplains units. \\nTheolder plains units (intercrater plains ofTrask andGuest) \\ncover about 16%oftheQuadrangle andareinterpreted tobe \\nmostly volcanic, based primarily onstratigraphic relationships. \\nYounger smooth plains units arealso interpreted tobelargely \\nvolcanic because they have noclear association with impact \\ncraters ofcomparable ageandsufficient size toindicate an \\nejecta origin. Theplains units have been emplaced concurrently \\nwith impacts over anextended period oftime early inthehisto- \\nryofMercury. Allplains material isconfined tobasins or \\nlow-lying regions within rougher terrain andestimates oftheir \\nthickness range from afewhundred meters toover ikm. \\nM.A.Leake (UA) hasmapped theentire incoming side of \\nMercury anddated plains material relative todegradational ages \\nofcraters embayed orsuperposed bytheplains. Shefinds \\nthat theoldintercrater plains span arange ofages concurrent \\nwith theperiod ofheavy bombardment represented bytheolder \\ndegraded craters. Plains depositions continued into interme- \\ndiate ageperiods. Theoldest intercrater plains cover ancient \\nfeatures indicating they arenotaprimordial surface. Most \\nintercrater plains andsmooth plains areinterpreted tobe \\nvolcanic deposits interbedded with ballistically emplaced \\nmaterial andcratered bylarge craters andnumerou_ secondaries. \\nThis interpretation isbased primarily onthedistribution of \\nplains material, decreasing butuncorrelated areal coverage by \\nboth craters andplains, andthelimited resurfacing potential \\nofmercurian craters. Furthermore, some positive relief \\nfeatures maybevolcanic constructs. Based ontransectional \\nrelationships thehilly andlineated terrain antipodal tothe \\n29\\n\\nCaloris basin appears tobethesame relative ageastheCalo- \\nrisimpact dated independently byMcCauley (USGS) etal. This \\nenabled theplains units ontheincoming side tobedated rela- \\ntive totheCaloris impact. Atleast ontheincoming side of \\nMercury, plains formation wasmore widespread inPre-Caloris \\ntime anddecreased gradually through Caloris andPost-Caloris \\ntime.\\nPROGRAM ACTIVITIES \\nThegeneral session consisted ofpresentations regarding \\nancillary support, administration andfunding ofresearch tasks \\ninthePlanetary Geology Program.

One of the specific objectives of solar Y--ray astronomy Is the study\\nof the high energy processes that occur in the outer region of the Sun\\'s\\natmosphere and. the relationship of these pbanamena to the basic problems of\\nsolar activity. A, measurement of the intensities of discrete y-ray line\\n7\\nemissions will reveal the detailed dynamics and time structure of solar flarse\\nand energetic particle acceleration.

During the Apollo 15 and\\nApolla 16 flights in 1971 and 1972, approximately 20 percent of the lunar\\nsurface was mapped for magnesium, aluminum ) thorium, potassium, uranium,\\nsilicon,^- ,titantium, and oxygen (Manger at al. 1973; Adler at al. 1972;\\nBjorkholm at al. 1973 ). A y-ray spectrometer aboard the Soviet Mars-5 orbiter\\nobtained several hours of data, from an altitude of about 2300 km, indicating\\nthat the average potassium, uranium, and thorium content of the regions\\nsurveyed corresponds to that of terrestrial rocks like oceanic basalts (Surkov\\net al. 1976). Three Soviet spacecraft, Venera .8, 9, and 10 haO carried as\\ny-ray spectrometer to measure -potassium, uraniuw,° and thorium, at the surfaee\\nof Venus by detecting thorium, decay of these naturally radioactive elements\\n(Surkov 19771. Direct comparisons of the results obtained from the lunar\\nsampW,s colleeted Burin the Apollo program show that this \"chemistry at a\\ndistance\" approach leads to quite reliable results*\\n(b) The Galaxy\\nThe oxistin$ knowledge oat \\tthe diffuse emissj^ on and source emission\\nfrom galactic. sources suggest, that the next steps in galactic *y-ray astronomy\\n6\\nmay be particularly rewarding. A number of high-energy y-ray 4alactic point\\nsources have been established, and there have been over two-dozen localized\\nexcesses identified by COS-$ (Wills ate. 1980). Many of the latter can\\nreasonably be expected to be point sources, and, therefore, instruments to be\\nFlown in the future with greater sensitivity and angular resolution should\\nreap a significant crop of y-ray ,,-.\\tBy measuring their\\nproportion, the nature of the mechanisms \\'capable of generating 1034 to over\\n1036 or& s-1 for sources such as FSK 0531+21, PSR\\'0832-45, and Cygnus X-3\\n(e.g. Kniffan at al. 1.974 ,,Bennet at al. 1977; Thompson, at al. 1977; Lamb et\\nal. 1977) in the form of high energy y-rays can be determined. In the next\\ndecarla$ there should be the chance of studying neutron stars, black holo^ ,\\npuls4rs # and supernovao in the y--ray region where the high energy processes\\nassociated with those objects should very likely be most clearly revealed.\\nThe detailed study of the gamma ray pulse profile and the variation of the\\ngamma ray sped ;, with pulse phase should contribute to the understanding of^(41\\nparticle acdeleration and Interaction in the magnetosphere of rotating noutroti\\nstars.\\nAs another example, there are now thought to be several ways that the\\npresence of a black liole might be revealed, and much of the predicted\\nradiation falls in the range of y-rays. In addition to several different\\npredictions of continuous y-r4diation from a black hole, there is also the\\nI\\nprediction of a very unique y-ray burst at the death of a small black hole;\\nsome of these bursts should be detectable with a large high energy y-ray\\ninstrument.\\nFurther, there is the possibility based on theoretical calculations 9,f the\\nj\\nobservation of y-ray lines particularly perhaps from supernovae and, Rance,\\nthe establishment of the sit es of aucleosynthesis. Various theories have also\\n7\\npredicted lines ) most commonly the half HeV lino. from al4ctron-poci t roil\\nannihilation, fro4l\"Compact objects. \\t 0\\nThei\\'high energy diffuse radiation from the galactic plane resulting fromI\\nthe interaction of the cosmic rays with interstellar matter And photons\\n\\'provides the opportunity to study the forces of change in the-Galaxy, the\\norigin and expansion of the cosmic-ray gas, and the galactic structure\\nincluding galactic arms and molecular clouds. Improved angular resolution and\\nsensitivity compared to that which has been achieved thus far in 1paca are\\nrequired to study the spatial distribution, and better energy resolution is\\nneeded to understand more clearly which mechanisms are dominate for the origin\\nof the high y-radiation. In Addition to the diffuse y-ray continuum existing\\nin our \\t iL is possible for distinct y--ray lines to be formed in the\\n7 InLergi4^^ctic medium. These lines may be created in several of the following\\nways: (i) The interaction of low- \"energy cosmic rays with both interstellar\\ngas and dust grains, (ii) the annihilation of positrons ) which have been\\nslowed down, with interstellar electrons, and (iii) the decay of nuclei which\\nin turn emit y-rays. These are interesting possibilities for gli b  19801s.\\nThe origin of the low energy y-ray bursts is unknown, as noted, but they\\nwill be included here in the discussion of the Galaxy to make certain they , are\\ndiscussed and to conform, with the more conservative current theories.- In\\norder to solve the mystery of the nature of the low energy Y--ray bursts, their\\nlocations must be estabUshed. With the exception of the March 5$ 1979 event\\n(Barat et al. 1979;. Cline ems. 1980; tvans at al. 1980) which seems unique\\nin many respects, no known X-ray or ,^-ray \"steady\" sources are included in the\\nfew well known positions, nor any other known example of exceptional classes\\nof astronomical objects, such as a pulsar or lhew supernova. It will b, , a\\nimportant to locate a large number of y-ray bursts accurately over the next\\ndecade it progress is to be made in understanding these bursts.\\n8\\nExtragala ctic Radiation\\nSeveral types of galaxies such as Utseteral objeetsi Sayfart galaxies,\\nand quasars emit more energy by\\'ordeva of magnitude than our own Salaxy,or\\nothar galaxies similar to it. The mere existence of these very energetic\\nc\\' galaxies together with their proposed explanations seem #nevitably to suggest\\nvery high energy phenomena, implying that y7ray astronomy should ultimately\\nmake a very important contribution to the understanding of the nature of these\\ngalaxies. Since y-ray astronomy has now moved below the threshold for\\ndetection of external galaxies with the observation of NOC 4151, 3C 273, and\\nCEN-,kt tha next generation of experiments should provid c\"n excellent\\nopportunity to study the high energy aspects of those extraordinary\\na^&Iaxlea. Further. atr4i ghtfqrward calculations based on the emission from\\nour own galaxy show that about a half dozen normal galaxies should be\\ndetectable with y-ray instruments an order of magnitude more sensitive than\\nthose already flown.1j\\nA diffuse celestial radiation, which is Isotropic at least on 4 coarse\\nscale, has been measured from the soft X-ray region to about 150 NO, at which\\nenergy the intensity falls below that of the galactic emission for most\\ngalactic latitudes. The spectral shape, the intensity, and the established\\ndegree of isotropy (altho^)gh data related to this latter property Is very\\nlimited) already place severe constraints on the possible explanations for\\nthis -radiation, For example, these considerations make a galactic halo model\\ninterpretation vary unlikely.\\n-Among thd extragalactic theories for this radiation, the more promising\\nexplanations appear to be radiation from exceptional galaxies (e.g., Strong,\\nWolfendale, and Worrall 1976; Ugnami, Fichtel, Hartman, and Thompson 1979) or\\nthe y-ray emission (Stacker, Morgan, Bredekamp 1971; Stacker 1978) from\\nmatter-antimattar annihilation at the boundaries of superclusters of galaxies\\nmatter And antimatter, In baryoa \\xadsymmetric^^ia-baas 004014 (\"OrOisoa 1967;\\nOnnias 1969; Brown and Stocker 1979). Definitive measur ements  whicicould\\nclearly distinguish between those two thoorioa are of ma jor scientific\\ninterest. The measurements on the diffuse fir- eradiation may, for example, be\\nthe only way to determine it the Univ4rse has baryon-antibAryon symmetry,\\n3, THE MISSION PROSPECTS FOR TUE 19801S\\nA significant portion of the hopes for y-rixy astronomy in the 1960\\'s Are\\ntied to the Gamma My ObservZtory proposed by NASA for on FY81 now start,\\nOther satellite missions devoted to y-ray astronomy or carrying I-ray\\nfi\\ninstrumonta include GAMMA-1, ) \\'the pair of Solar Polar satellites ) the V, `ora\\nseries, possible planetary And cometary missions, other satellites carrying\\nburst detectors, and possibly an \\t \"cad solar observatory and the Spaca\\nPlatform later in the decade, It is also hoped that there will be \\'improved\\nground level telescopes for the very high energy y-rays.\\n(a) GAMMA I\\nThe next y-ray satellite expected to fly is GAJ,1MA 1, which Is as joint\\neffort of four Soviet and two French laboratories and is to be launched in the\\nearly 1980\\'s on a Soviet satellite.

There would be several\\nlarge y-ray experiments which together would study six decades of energy\\nranging from 0.03 XeV to 3X104 t1eV, with a major increase In sensitivity over\\nprevious satellite experiments. The scientific goals of this mission can be\\nsummarized as follows:\\nA study of the dynamic, evolutionary forc+ ,s in compact objects such\\n-as neutron stars and black holes, as well as y-ray emitting objects\\nwhose nature is yet to be understood,\\nii. A search for evidence of nucleosynthesis - the fundamental building\\nprocess in nature - particularly in the environment of supernovae.\\niii, The exploration of our galaxy in the y-ray range particularly with\\nra,gard \\'ta regions difficult to observe at other wAvelengtha, the\\norigin »,,id dynamic pressure effects of the cosmic rays, and\\nl\\t structural features particularly related to high-energy particles.\\niv.

The Venera ser`,, m and possible planetary, cometary,\\nor astrold satellites can contribute to this network in an imporLant way# The\\nlong baselines available In this network together with the already existing\\naccurate Vii-ning should provide substantially improved„ position determinations*\\nwhich should clearly identify the objects froth `which these ``bursts came if they\\nare in fact clearly seen at other wavalangths.\\nIn addition to the excellent positional determination to be obtained by\\nthis network, the presently planned GRO burst detector will be able to obser,\\ntime -Ariations down t\\xado\"O,l ma for strong sources and to detect spectral\\nvariations on relatively short titae scales, These observations will allow tl\\nstudy of models of emission mechanisms and source geometry in detail, For\\nexample$ models based,on radioactive decay, cooling of a hot plasma, and\\nsynchrotron emission foll9wing sudden injections of relativistic electrons\\n13\\nc^\\ninto a str^,ng magnetic field would each predict different spectral variations\\nduring a burst. The GRO instrument will also contribute in another way. The\\ndetectors on interplanetary spacecraft are, of necessity, small and relatively\\ninsensitive. As a result, only the strongest bursts can be located by the\\nnetwork being discussed. However, numerous additional; bursts that are Coo\\nweak to be detected by the interplanetary network will be detectable with the\\nlarge area monitors aboard GRO. Their position\\'s may be determined to about\\none degree or better by comparing the responses of individual detectors\\npointed in different direct,tons.

Each will carry a\\nscintillation detector to measure the time history of solar •y-tfays and four-\\nchannel energy resolution in the range from 15 to 150 keV. The energy\\nspectral information_,ill be obtained every 12 seconds. The results should\\naid markedly in the study of the fundamental nature of the acceleration,\\nstorage, and escape processes of energetic electrons in solar flares.

The Crab and Vela pulsars\\nhave been studied extensively in the last few years by SAS2 (Kniffen et al.\\n1974p Thompson et al. 1975) and by COSD (Bennett et al. 1977) at energies\\nabove 30 MeV. Thy: Y-ray emission from these pulsars i q a much higher fraction\\nof the total energy loss rate than the radio emission and, therefore, must\\nplay a major role in the radiation mechanism. The energy spectra of the\\nCrab and Vela ;cave recently been reanalyzed in the range 50 MeV-2 GeV from\\nCOSB data (Lichti et al. 1980), and they fit steep power laws with slopes of\\n-2.17 and -1.89.1\\nAlthough only a small fraction of the 328 known radio pulsars hays\\nbeen detected in the Y-ray range, it is possible that many of these pulsars\\nare emitting pulsed Y-rays below the present detectability limits. If Y-ray\\nemission is a general characteristic, an important question is whether the\\nproduction mechanism is the same for all pulsars. The similar pulse shapes\\nand spectra of the Crab and Vela argue strongly in favor of a single mechanism\\nfor these two pulsars, though their properties are quite different at other\\nenergies. From a theoretical point o£ view, it is essential to try to establish\\nthe characteristics of pulsar Y-ray emission in specific models for the whole\\nrange of pulsar parameters such as period and magnetic field strength. When\\nY-ray data on other pulsars becomes available from more sensitive detectors,\\nit may then be possible to use these characteristics as a test of certain\\nmodels for Y-ray pulsars as a class.\\nl\\nDetection of pulsed emission from PSR1747-46 has also been reported\\n(Ogelman et al. 1976, Thompson et al. 1976), but this result is now in question\\nbecause of a recent radio timing observation (Newton et al„ 1980) which\\nmeasured a much lower period derivative than was used to determine the I-ray\\nlight curve.\\n2\\nIt is the purpose of this paper to outline some observable charac-\\nteristics of pulsar \\'Y-ray emission in a particular model and to determine\\na general luminosity ,formula which is a function of pulsar parameters.\\nThis model assumes that the Y-ray emission above 100 MeV is produced b*\\nprimary particles undergoing curvature radiation in the magnetic field\\nabove the pulsar polar cap. \\'these particles have been accelerate=d along\\nfield lines by the intense electric fields induced by rotation. Because\\nof the extremely high energies to which the particles are accelerated\\n(Sturrock 1971; Ruderman and Sutherland 1975; Scharlemann, Arons and Pawley\\n1978), their curvature radiatior,4 spectrum extends well into the Y-ray range.\\nThe most important attenuation mach:.;riot affecting these Y -rays is magnetic\\nfield induced pair production, which becomes important around 500 MeV.\\nThe details of this model were presented in an earlier paper (Harding,\\n1\\'ademaru and Esposito 1978, hereafter referred to as taper T), in which\\nthe Y-rays were traced from their emission points through the rotating\\nmagnetosphere and attenuated by pair production. Optical depths, pulse\\nshapes, and spectra were calculated in the case where the emitting\\nprimary particles are monoenergetic. It was found. that pulsar rotation\\nincreases the amount of pair production, primarily through the induced\\nelectric field perpendicular to the magnetic field. The electric field\\nincreases the pair production rate above the value it would have in a\\npure magnetic field (Daugherty and Lerche 1975). As a result, high\\nenergy )\\'-rays tire more severely attenuated in short period pulsars. Salvati\\nand Massaro (1978) obtained similar results using the same type of model., but\\nincluding some synchrotron radiation from secondary pairs.\\nw\\n3\\nThis paper assumes a monoenergetic injection spectrum of primaries and\\ntakes into account the energy loss of the particles as they radiate (5 TI).\\nThis produces steeper Y-ray spectra than those calculated in Paper I for\\nconstant primary particle energy. Numerically calculated spectra for various\\npulsar parameters and primary particle energies are presented in 5 III and\\nare compared to the COSD spectra of the Crab and Vela. In S IV Y the\\nA ependence of Y -ray luminosity on period and magnetic: field strength is\\nderived from the integrated spectra. A prediction of the dependence of\\nefficiency on characteristic age is also discussed.\\nII. CURVATURE RADIATION SPECTRUM\\nPaper I describes the basic assumptions and approximations of the\\nmodel and also the numerical technique used to calculate the pair production\\nrate as the photons move out from their emission points. The emission\\nspectrum here differs from that described in paper I in that it allows for\\nenergy loss by the emitting particles as they move out from the accelerating\\nregion. The calculation does not deal with the specifics of the acceleration\\nmechanism but rather assumes that the particles somehow reach highly\\nrelativistic energies near the star.\\nSeveral methods of particle acceleration above the polar cap have\\nbeen discussed (Ruderman and Sutherland 1975; Seharlemann Arons and Fawley\\n1978; Arons and Scharlemann 1979) as well as acceleration in the outer\\nmagnetosphere (Cheng, Ruderman, and Sutherland 1976). These studies determine\\nthe energy, Y o, to which the particles are accelerated as a function of\\nI\\n4\\nperiod P, magnetic field strength B o, and radius of curvatooe, Rc, of the\\nfield lines. It is Bound that, while very large electric fields can be induced\\nalong the B field lines, acceleration is basically limited by pair production\\ndischarges which short out the E field. As a result of these competing\\nprocesses each of which depend on r and b o, the not potential drop has only a\\nweak dependence on these pw.;u ters. In this calculation, we will simply\\nassuage that Yo does not depend either on E or Bo.\\nWe assume that a monoonergeti .c beam of primary particles of energy Yo\\nIs injected uniformly over the polar cap And moves out along dipole field\\nlines. As the particles radiate, they will be losing energy at a rate\\ncurve\\tme\\tc\\t(1)\\nwhere 11c 01 3 8 is the magnetic field line radius of curvature for n dipole\\nfield. The equilibrium distribution of particles at (r,e) will be,\\nve NAY a )\\t(x°)\\t^` Ymax (►e)\\t(2)\\ncury\\nwhere Ymax (r,8) is the maximum particle energy at (r,O), obtained by\\nintegrating the expression for (dY /dt)cury along a field line:\\nYmax (r,e) .

The radiation will be highly beamed in a\\ndirection tangent to the field lines, and emission points are chosen so\\nthat photons in a given part of the pulse arrive at a stationary observer\\nsimultaneously. The deter mination of emiaaiou points and the subsequent\\nattenuation of the radiation by pair production has been detailed in Paper\\n1. Since the secondary pairs are produced at an angle to the field, they\\nwill lose most of their energy by synchrotron radiation. While this\\nradiation may contribute to the Y-ray spectrum, the contribution above\\n100 NO will come from the high energy tail of the steep primary spectrum.\\nWe assume that this is a small effect, though it has not been fully determined,\\nand neglect the radiation from secondary p%articles in the present calculation.\\nIII. CALCULATED SPECTRA\\nSpectral points are calculated in this model by integrating the intensity\\nat a given photon energy across the pulse profile. The free parameters\\ndetermining the shape and magnitude of the spectrum are the period P, the\\nsurface magnetic field strength B O, the initial primar-I particle energy Yb,\\n1\\n7\\n1\\nand number dencvity no The angle between the magnetic field and spin axes is\\ntaken to be 90 0 in all calculations, with the observer\\'s line of sight passing\\nthrough the magnetic pole.\\na1\\nFor given values of P and B oo Yo uniquely determines the shape of the\\nspectrum and n determines the normalisation. Figures 1. 2, and 3 show\\ncalculated spectra for n - 1 and various values of B oo To and P. The value\\nof Yo clearly tins a large effect on the curvature radiation cutoff which\\nis in part responsible for the turnover in the spectrum at \\'high energies.\\nPair production also steepens the high energy part of the spectrum and\\ndepends on both P and H o. The effect of P can be seen by comparing the\\nshapes of the spectra shown in each Figure, which are calculated for the\\nsaue values or Bo and Yo. The spectra steepen at lower energies for shorter\\nperiod pulsars as a result of the higher pair production rates caused by\\nrotation. Increasing Bo also increases pair production and, therefore,\\nalso has a steepening effect on the spectrum. The spectra for P - .089 s.\\nin Figures 1 and 2 are nearly identical, in shape to the spectra obtained by\\nSalvati and Massaro (1978) in their Figures 4a and 4b for Bo = 10 1P gauss.\\nSince they have included a contribution from secondary pairs and our calcula-\\ntions have not, it appears that the secondary pairs do not contribute\\nsignificantly to the spectrum abo,-re 100 MeV.\\nIf a value H o W 1012 gauss is assumed, then the best fit spectrum to\\nthe COSH data \\'points for the Crab with P - .033 s. is the one having\\nY0 _ 3x107 and requires that n _ 1.2 x 10 3 for normalization at 100 MeV (assuming\\na distance of 2 kpc.) A lower value of Ya will fall below the high energy\\nf\\t points. These same values for Yo, n and Bo, but with P - .089 so also\\nfit the spectral points for Vela quite well (assuming a distance of 0.5 kpc.)\\nThese spectra and their fits to the data are shown in Figure 4. The fact\\nthat both the Crab and Vela spectra can be fit with the same value of Yo\\n8\\nstrongly supports the prediction of acceleration theodoo that thn p*rticla\\nenergy depends only weakly, if at all, on the pulsar period. It alai) indicates\\nthat, in order to account for the highest energy \\'y-radiation from these pulears,\\nthey acceleration mechanism must be capable of producing particles with y \\n3x107. and purticle densities n — 1.0 3 tames the corotation charge density. 9nergies\\nthis high are not acheived in the present models for acceleration above the polar\\ncap where potentials on ly reach — 10 12 volts, though particle densities of this\\nmagnitude are. Poss-i\\'bly, the highest energy particles are a+ccalernted, or reac-\\ncelerated, in outer gaps where potentials can reach - 10 14 volts (Chang, 2uderman\\nand Sutherland 1976). An we have found in Paper Iy high enargy photons which are\\nobserved must actual? y he prn, -44 d further out in the ma gnotosohere.

Y-AAY LUMINOSITY\\nilia calculated spectra have been integrated for a range of pulsar periods\\nand magnetic field strengt1w to obtain the dependence of Y-ray luminosity on\\nthese parameters. A fit to the numerically integrated spectra gives an\\nexpression for the luminosity above 100 MeV, normalized to the Crab with\\nLy (> 100 MeV) \\t1.4 x 1.038 photon 9-1 and B12 - 3.8,\\n(> 100 MeV) R 1.2 x 1035 9125 P-1.7 photons 8-1\\t (8)\\nwhere B12 is in units of 1.0 12 gauss. This formula gives L, (> 100 MeV) -\\n2.3 x 1037 s-1 for the parameters of Vela (B12 3.4, p . .089 s), which\\nis in good agreement with the observed value 2.4 x 1037 s-1 (Lichti at al. 1980).\\n9\\nWithout considering the attenuation due to pair production, one would\\naxpett in this type of model that\\nLy yo N n rP co ,\\t(^)\\nwhere r  is the polar cap radius. If yo is independent of P and B o, as we\\nhave assumed, N o M B0P-1, and r  . r  (A ro/0) a P 4, then L  « Bo g•-2.\\nThe departures from this dependence in egvAtion (8) therefore result from\\nthe inclusion of pair production attenuation. Since pair production is\\ngreater in shorter period pulsars, their luminosities are decreased relative\\nto longer period pulsars.\\nLuminosities and fluxes for other pulsars can be predicted from equation\\n(8). The magnetic field strength is usually estimated from the amount of\\nradiation reaction torque implied by the value of the period derivative, P\\n(Ostri.ker and Gunn 1969)\\nBo d a2. x 1 .019 I/rob\\t (P ; )* gauss.\\n(1G9 g cm-4\\t(10)\\nWhile it is reasonable to assume that all neutron stars have comparable\\nmasses, and therefore simil ar moments of inertia, I, and radii, ro, it is\\nalso possible that the range of observed PP indicates a range of neutron\\nstar masses. In other word \\'s, it is possible that the value of B 0 is the\\nsame for all pulsars. However, observational determinations of the masses\\nof neutron stars in orbit around binary companions (Rappaport and Joss 1979,\\nTaylor et. al. 1979) have all been consistent with 1.4 f 0.2 11 0, which seems\\na\\n10\\nto suggest a very small mass range. Tile observed values of PP 41.80 give\\na reasonable range for B o (2 x 1010 - 2 x 1013 sauna) if 4 constant value\\nof I/rob is assumed.\\t\\nFor pulsars with measured values of \\tthe estimates of B 0, assuming\\t\\ncanonical values of 1 . 10 45 g cm  and r \\t106 cm, are used in deriving\\nthe luminosity. For all other pulsars, a value of B oa 1.01\\'2 gauss is\\nassumed. The pulsars with the high est predicted Y-ray fluxes are listed\\nin Table 1 with tneir luminosities and other measured parameters from\\nManchester and Taylor (1950). Most of these have fluxes wall below those\\nof the Crab (PSR 0531 + 21) and Vela (PSR 0833- 45), but a few have comparable\\npredicted fluxes. Eight are above the point source detectability limit of\\nCOSO, but all are either outside the latitude range of the search or near\\nthe galactic center where the diffuse background is high. All of the pulsars\\nin Table 1 with previously reported period derivatives have been searched for\\npulsed Y-ray emission by SAS2 and COSB. The predicted fluxes for PSR 0950 + 080\\nPSR 1642-03, PSR 1706 -16 and PSR 192V + 10 exceed the Flux upper limits reported\\nby SAS2 (Ogelman et al. 1976), but by no more than a factor of 3. This is not\\na serious discrepancy, considering that the errors in the SAS2 limits are of\\nthe same magnitude.\\nPulsar Y-ray efficiency is defined as the .fraction of the total energy loss\\nrate which is radiated in Y-rays. From equation (8) and the expression for the\\nrotational energy Loss rate,\\ndE\\ndt . O 2 1 P3 taus s`1,p\\nthe efficiency above 100 MeV will be\\n11, (> 100 Mev) \\t2 0 x 10 31 .95 p1.3\\n^Y - dE dt \\t4^.I_____ S12 p •(11)\\n(l2)\\n11\\ni\\n1i\\nFor constant moment of inertia, the efficiency can be expressed in\\nterms of the pulsar\\'s characteristic age, T \\t(P/;) , using equation (10):i\\t1\\n^Y 4x10\"14 ;1.3 T1.8 \\t(13)\\nwhere P is in units of 10-15 s s-1 and T is in years. For the two pulsars\\nwith measured Y-ray luminosities, there seems to be an increase in efficiency\\nwith age. Figure 5 shows that the quantity ^Y P-1\\'3 plotted against T for\\nthese pulsars is consistent with a T 1-8 dependence. Equation (13) predicts\\nthat 711 will exceed 1 above some characteristic age wh:!ch is equal to — 3x107\\nyears for P\\',• 10-15 s s-1. This suggests that the Y-ray emission mechanism\\nmay turn off before this point since the efficiency cannot exceed 1. One\\nexplanation for a Y-ray turnoff is that the primary particle energy, which\\nwas assumed to be constant in deriving equation (la), begins dereasing\\nwith increasing P at the point where the induced electric fields are no\\nlonger shorted out by pair production. Beyend this point;, the acceleration\\ngrows weaker, producing fewer and lower energy Y-rays, which also cannot\\nproduce the particle-photon cascades necessary for the radio emission.\\nThe fact that there are few radio pulsars (with measured values of P) which\\nhave characteristic ages greater than \\'— 3x107 years implies that the radio\\nemission also turns off around this value of T and may be the result of a\\nT-ray turnoff.\\nThese results on pulsar Y-ray efficiency roughly agree with the estimate\\nof Buccheri et al. (1978) that I I a T. They also have estimated Y-ray fluxes\\n.\\nfor 88 pulsars with measured values of P and listed those considered to be\\npotentially observab lke. All of the pulsars in Table 1 do not appear in the\\nlist of Buccheri et al. because many did not have measured values of p at\\nthe time. They also chose a lower limit to the flux detectability of the\\nCOSB satellite of 0.,1 times the Crab flux and therefore included some pulsars\\nwith lower predicted fluxes which do not appear in our list.\\n12\\nV4 DISCUMON\\nThia papar had imeatigatod tim depondonom of pulunr y-ray tspuctra,\\nand lujiviliogitiais on tho pulsar poriod and liwasuatic fiald strangth III a,\\nmodul wham thd 7- •ayo ava produe4d by cuvvdtura vadiatiou from primoxy\\npartieloo.

In general the results of the Pioneer 10 pass at\\n900 to the Jupiter-Sun line have been confirmed and ext^jhded ► The region\\nbetween 20 and 150 kJ is dominated by a thin plasma sheet, and open field\\nlines were observed at 42 R J at a magnetic latitude of only 15 0. Trapped\\nenergetic electron and proton fluxes reach their maximum in the plasma sheet\\nand decrease rapidly even a few degrees away from it. The spectra of trapped\\nE\\t protons can be represented by an exponential in rigidity and have a\\nr,characteristic energ fz!of - 50 keV. proton anisotropies in the plasma sheet\\nwere\\'.^onsistant with:-torotation even at 100 R d, but the preliminaryo analysis\\nis not yet concl,usve+\\'A major proton acceleration event as well as se veral\\ncases of .field-aligned proton streaming were observed. Comparable proton\\nfluxes were observed in the plasma sheet by Voyagers 1 and 2. The fluK.of\\nI\\t\\n\\t 7 0.4 Mev protons decreases by, three orders of magnitude between 20 and 90 Rj\\nand then remains relatively constant to the boundary layer near the\\nMagnetopause. Between,^,20 and 30 It in the anti-solar direction, the trapping\\nregion has a latitudinal extent which is comparable to that observed during\\nthe i.nbaund ; pass at -300 solar aspect. The plasma sheet. positions in the\\nmagnetotail can be represented by a distorted disk which rotates about the\\nJovian spin axis. Fine structure in the .data indicate longitudinal\\nasymmetries with respect to the dipole orientation. Electron spectra in the\\nouter magnetosphere,, the magnetosheath and\\'laterpl,anetary space ar& modulated\\nby the Jovian:, l.oagi.tude relative to the subsoUr point; this confirms the\\nPioneer 10 and 11 results.\\n^J\\ne\\t \\'\\nItltlt\\nii\\t\\nIntroducc, on\\nThe Voyager I and 2 passes by Jupiter offered the first opportunity since\\n1974 to perform in situ investigations of the Jovian magnotoophere, The\\ncosmic ray subsystem (CRS) observed energetic electrons and protons between\\n0.4 and 10 MeV and ions above 1.8 MeV/nucleon, The latter results are\\n\"A\\nd,escri,VP,4 in the companion paper. While the outbound trajectory passed\\nthrough the dawn magnetotail, a previously unexplored region, the inbound\\nu\\ntrajectory Orough the subsolar \\'hemisphere followed relatively closely the\\npath previously taken by Pioneers 10 and 11 (Figs 1), Summaries ,of thq1new\\nresults were publistfed by Vogt et al. (1.979ab).\\nThe two passes through the subsolar hemisphere confirmed in general the\\nPioneer results (a summary and references to the Pioneer results ark given in\\nthe review article by Goertz and Thomsen, 1979). A?(axpected, the\\nm,agnetopause position was variable and several crossings were obseryed between\\n45 and 80 R j (Jupiter radii). In the outer magnetosphere (>45 R d) fluxes•of\\nlow energy protons (0.4 to 3 MeV) were variable but showed no consistent 10-\\nhour modulation. High-energy electrons (>8 MeV) did show a modulation which\\nwas in phase with prediction from the so-called albck model (Chenette t al,,\\n1974; Smith et al., 1976).\\nInside 40 R j, a well-developed Jurrent sheet was encountered which,-was\\nclosely aligned with the magnetic equator. Because of the 10.4 0 tilt between\\nthe\"magnotie dipole and Jupiter\\'s spin axis,,this current sheet moved up and\\nQ\\ndown with Jupiter\\'s 10-hour period.\\' Since Voyager was always within 5 0 of tyre\\nequator, two crossings occurred every 10 hours. Fluxes of both energetic electrons\\nand protons peaked at the magnetic equator. In the case of Voyager 1 0 the proton\\nfluxes observed at the crossing \\'Lhear XIII 3009 (1965) were 30 to 70% more\\nintense than those a lhsociated with the crossing near A \\t1000. No such\\nconsistent difference was present in the Voyager 2 data. The Voyager I\\nobservations suggest that an asymmetry exists at times In the flux o f trapped\\nenergetic particles which may be associated with the so-called active and\\ninactive hemispheres (Vasyliunas, 1975; Desslar, 1978).\\nIn the Inner magnetosphere, absorption features in the low energyproton\\npopulation (-2 MaV) were associated with Ganymade, Europa and to, During its\\nrebound pass, Voyager 2 came within 63,000 km of Ganymada; the large disturbances\\nin the proton, flux which correlate with similar disturbances in magnetic field\\nand plasma parameters have. \\tascribed 0 a possible wake created by 04nymodele\\nh\\nmotion through the magna ton pher15?\\'p lasma (Hurlaga at al., 1980). Naar Ganymede.1 a\\norbit o Umpson at al. (1975) had 4evi6usly,obb drved  with Pioneer 11 numerous\\nburats of ^l MOV protons which t ypical-ly lastod le- a than 1 minute,, but 044\\nmagnetic field signature observed at the same time was quite different (Itivalson\\nand Wing, 1976) from that observed by Voyager 2.,, As already noted from Pioneer\\ndata, the lo-aasociate4\\'dearease in proton flux starts at L w 6.2, well outside\\nof Io la orbit slid appears to be primarily due to interactions with the To plasma\\ntorus rather than geometric absorptiq^ii by to itself.\\nThe major now region investigated, and to bo-\\'discussed in this paper, is the\\ndown, magnetotail (Fig. 1) Table 1).\\tThe Pioneer 10 and Voyager outbound passes\\nprovide data 1;etween -1000 and -1350 from the Jupitar-Sun line all the way out to\\nthe magnetopause and in the anti-solar direction (f4idnight) at 21 Rj•\\tAs in the\\ncase-of Pioneer 10, we found a thiwplasma cheat at the magnetic equator wliieh\\nwas already well developed near 23 Rj,\\tSharp flux maxima.\\tproton and alectron,\\n(0 MaV) population occurred near the sheet and permitted us to follow t\"he\\nZ7 \\nthe sheet out to 160 R j-\\tAt a latitude of -150 away from\" posit4on of the plas \\t M\\nplasma sheet, the proton flux dropped to its interplanetary value*\\nThe proton spectra observed,in the ,magnetotail agreed generally with those\\n..........\\nIN\\t\\n3\\nobserved during the outbound pass of Pioneer 10; however, we have now spectra\\nmeasured in different directions relative to the magnetic field. Most of the\\ntime, observed spectral differences are small and reflect the affects of\\ncorotation and of spatial gradients of the proton spectrum. At times, the plasma\\nsheet was active and quite different spectra were observed parallel and\\nperpendicular to the field. Proton streaming along the field and Away from\\nJupiter was observed on several occasions with anisotropies its high as 400:1. In\\nthe plasma sheet at 155 P.., Voyager 2 observed a very anisotropie (20:1) proton\\nflow which was apparently accompanied by a super Alfvenic flow of an oxygen-\\nsulfur plasma away from Jupiter (Krimigis, et at. 1980).\\nThe many new observations of the plasma sheet position place additional\\nconstraints on the models developed after the Pioneer missions. Out data agree\\nbest with a model that involves a gradual bending of the plasma sheet towards the\\nJovigraphic equAor (Br:Ldge et. al., 1979). Since a much smaller or no bending\\nwas observed with Pioneer-10, we have to assume that conditions in the plasma\\nsheet changed between 1973 and x97.9. An alternate model keeps the plasma sheet\\ninclination fixed at 10.4 0 and accounts for the differences on the basis of\\ndifferent longitudes at which the plasma sheet was crossed. The latter model,\\nhowever, does not explain the absence, of plasma sheet crossings\"beyond 80 Rj\\nduring the Voyager 1 mission.\\nThe periodic modulation of the energetic electron flux continues in the\\nmagnetosheath and interplanetary space ,(Chenette et al., 1974)* however, the\\ncharacter of this modulation is different from that observed in the plasma sheet\\nregion. The proton flux does not participate in this modulation, and minima in\\nA\\nthe energetic electron flux occur simultaneously at all places where it has been\\nobserved, hence the name \"clock\" modulation. This modulation must be caused bv\\n\\'(975) , and we show that an asymmetry that rotates with Jupiter (Dessler and Hill I\\nit is apparently directly associated with the active hemisphere.\\n\\'4\\tof\\nc;\\n0\\nInstrumentation\\nAs its name implies, the CKS was designed for cosmic ray studies (Stone et\\nal., 1977). It consists of two High Energy Telescopes (NET), four. Low Energy\\nTelescopes (LET) and The Electron Telescope (TET). The detectors have large\\ngeometric factors (-0.48 to ,8 cm2 stet) and long electronic time constants (-24\\t .\\npsec) for low power consumption and__goad stability. Normally the data are\\nprimarily derived from comprehensive (QF. ia 4E2 and E) purse-height information\\nabout individual events. Because of the high particle fluxes encountered at\\nJupiter, greater reliance had to be p\\'iaced on counting rates in single detectors\\nand various coincidence rates. The detectors used for most of our work arek\\nlisted in Table 2 In interplanetary space, guard counters are placed i^)anti-\\ncoincidence with the primary detectors to reduce the \\'background from nigh-energy\\nparticles penetrating through the sides of the telescopes. These guard counters\\n0\\nwere turned off in the Jovian magnetosphere, when the accidental anti-coincidence\\nrate became high enough to block a substantial Fraction of the desired cots.\\n1\\nFortunately, under these conditions the spectra were sufficiently soft that the\\nbackground due to penetrating particles was small.\\nThe data on proton and ion fluxes at Jupiter were obtained with\\'the Low\\nEnergy Telescope, LET (F. 2 and Table 2). The thicknesses of individual solid- .9 \\ta\\nstate detectors In the LET and their trigger thresholds were chosen such that\\neven, in the ,Jovian magnetosphere, electrons made no contribution to the proton\\ncounting rates (Lupton and Stone, 1972). Dead time corrections and accidental\\ncoincidences were small (X20%) throughout most of the magnetota l but were\\nsubstantial (>50%) at flux maxima within 40 R J of Jupiter. Results in this paper \" \\tr\\nare based only on>da,ta obtained on the rising part of the detector responsew\\n(prior to roll-over) and were corrected with the dead time appropriate to the\\t F\\ndetector (22 to 25 }sec). The high counting rates, however, caused some baseline\\n.\\t shift which was insignificant compared to the energy of heavy ions (Carbon to\\nJ\\n:\\nSulfur) but may have raised proton thresholds \\' significantly. In the inner\\nmagnetosphere, the L 2 counting rate was still useful because it never rolled\\np\\tpenetrating L 1 (0.43 cm 2 star) over. This rate is due to l .$ to 13 MeV protons enetr \\tI\\nand J9 MeV protons penetrating the shield (84 cm2 stet)`: For an E-2 spectrum,\\nutho two groups would snake comparable contributions, but in the magnetosphere for \\ta\\nthe B-3 to E\"4 spectrum above 2.5 MeV (McDonald at al., 1979 )0 the contribution\\nfirom protons penetrating the shield would be only 3 to 14X.\\nThe LET LLL 2U coincidence-anti.conci.dence rate gives an accurately defined \\ta\\nproton flux between 1.8 and 8 MeV with a very small alpha particle con tribution\\n010\"5). Corrections are required for dead time losses in Ll, accidental LIL2\\ncoincidences, and anticoi.ncidence losses from L 4. The anticolneidence time\\nconstant was count-rate dependent; for low rates it was 27 psec and gradually\\n1\\t^\\ndecreased to 10 psec at maximum counting rate. A third-order polynomial in the \\t j\\nL4 rate was used to express the antcoincidence dead time. In correcting fox;:\\naccidental, coincidences between L l and L2, account was taken of the fact that a\\nmajor fraction of the counts in L 2 were in coincidence with L 16 An average\\naccidental coincidence time constant of 16 psee was \\'used. , The actual accidental\\ncoincidence time constant was in the range of 10 to 25 psec with a complex\\ndependence on pulse height and rate.\\nIn addition to the rates listed in Table 2, the energy lost in detectors L10\\nL2 and L3was measured for individual particles. For protons this covered the\\nenergy range from 0.42 to 8.3 MeV. Protons can be identified positively by the\\n4E vs. g technique, their spectra obtained and accidental coincidences greatly\\nreduced. Because of telemetry limitations, however, only a small fraction of the\\nevents could be transmitted, and statistics become poor unless pulse-height data\\nare averaged over one hour for one detector or 15 minutes when summed over the\\nfour LETs.\\nr0\\n3^-\\n_F\\np:\\t\\n5\\n•J\\nn\\nEach Voyager spacecraft carried four LETS; three of these looked in\\nmutually-perpendicular directions Such that LET -A 0 -D and yg,\\nformed a right-\\nhanded coordinate system. LET-C looked in the minus A direction. Figure I shows\\ni the typical directions in which the telescopes were pointed during the outbound\\npasses of Voyager 1. The actual directions beyond 30 R J were within *W of\\nI\\tthose shown fn Figure 3, which gives the exact directions for Voyager l at 50\\nI\\n\\'i\\tR. LgT-h was nearly parallel to the average magnetic field during the outbound\\npawn, and the other three telescopes looked almost perpendicular to the field.\\nLET-A pointed 6b* north from the plane of the ecliptic but <<^rot }&rwiso towards the\\nJ\\ncorotation direction, and LET-D pointed nearly in Ghd corot\\'ation direction.\\nRelative intensities and differences in energy spectra for these directions can\\nbe determined. If hi.ghor-orderan sotroptes era tmall ^owplirced to,0*i ;first\\norder anisotropy, then the average, .flux, first.-order ,,anisotropy and its directio,\\ncan be determined uniquely. At Jupiter, however, the first- and second-order\\nanisotropes are often comparable (McDonald et al., 1979), and such a simple\\nanalysis would be misleading except when two or three detectors point\\nr\\t perpendicular to the magnetic field,.\\nOne HET and two LETS share the same data lines and pulse-height analyzers;\\nthus the three telescopes can interfere°with one another during periods of high \\t ^!\\ncounting rates. To avoid this and explore different coincidence conditions, the\\nexperiment was cycled through four operating modes, each 192 .:-seconds long.\\nEither the HET or the two LETs were turned on at a time. The LETS were cycled\\nthrough L i only, and T. 1L2 coincidence requirements. Some of the time, one of the\\nLETS was operated only in the L 1L2L3 coincidence mode to improve statistics for\\nr\\thigher energy particles and reduce interference from spacecraft noise.

Periodic plasma sheet crossings or approaches\\ncan be identified beyond 150 R j. In contrast, no clear cut modulation of low\\nenergy proton fluxes has been seen beyond 45 R j in the subsolar hemisphere.\\nThe latitudinal extent of the energetic particle trwppilng region is probably\\ncontrolled by a pressure balance between the Jovkan magnetic field, trapped\\nthermal plasma, and solar wind pressure. The Interactions between forces due to\\nthe Jovian magnetic field and centrifugal forces concentrate the plasma into a;\\nsheet near the equator (Gleesoa and Axford, 1976). In the sabsolar hemisphere,\\nthe addition of the solar wind\\'pressure insures that the sheet is relatively\\nthick. When a section of the magqftosphere rotates.,from the subsolat hem`i.sphere\\ninto the antisolar directIon,-the trapped thermal plasma can expand radially\\noutward because tliasolar wind pressure is,removed. The expansion speed is1\\nlimited by the wave velocity to be discussed later (Table 5).

These results are complemented by data from the\\noutbound pass of Pionjer 10 (Fig. 8),which provides a better spatial\\nresolution for the behavior of the spectral index in the plasma sheet. Since\\nPionee,1 10 was at a IECtltude of -9\\', the plasma sh pet approached and receded \\tA\\nfrom it more gradually; additionally,,the spectrum could be determined every\\n15 minutes. The Pioneer 10 observations show that the spectrum of trapped\\nparticles is hardest at the center of the plasma sheet and becomes\\nsignificantly softet-a short distance (-l*) above it.

As can be seen from Figure 9, these periods cover most of\\nthe intense activity. The spectrum and average intensity of streaming protons\\nis characteristic of the trapped proton population in the plasma sheet\\n(compare pigs. 6 and 10). The spectra and.intensities of locally mirroring\\nprotons are characteristic of interplanetary protons. The relative fluxes and\\nspectra indicate that we observed field-aligned streaming of energetic protons\\ncharacteristic of the normally trapped plasma sheet population. Peak\\nintensities in LET B were as high as those found at -40 RJ• The most likely\\ncause is a field line reconfiguration (magnetic, merging?) between Jupiter and\\nVoyageA^ which injected protons onto open field lines. This process was\\nprobably associated with proton acceleration because no corresponding changes,,a\\nn\\nwere foul in the electron population. If the electrons were closely\\ncollimated along the magnetic field, however, we could have MiL sel streaming\\nns because  the d detector geometry was less favorable. el.ectr_ o \\t e\\t g\\t y\\t a;s\\nFive protoa streaming events are lisc:ed in Table 4.

(1980) have analyzed the\\nproton and heavier ion spectra associates with the 155 ki event and concluded\\nthe they were probably seeing an oxygen-sulfur plasma moving away from Jupiter\\nwith a velocity corresponding to a mean ion energy of 100 kaV.\\nIn summary, we have observed three different types of proton streaming\\nevents. Wall inside the magnatopause at 98 load 133 RT, we detected field-\\naligned streaming in the plasma shout in an ordered magnetic field\\nconfiguration. Near the ,magnet opause, but still inside the magnotosphereo the\\nlarge afiisotropies appear to be due to a comb,614tion of fast plasma motion\\ncoupled with field-aligned flow in an irregular field configoration, and id\\nthe dawn, magnatosheath we see proton and electron streamirtg. These\\no\\ni\\nt\\nr16\\nobservations have many similarities with analogous observations at earth as\\nreported by Sarris at al., (1976) and by Frank at al,, (1976) in his\\nfireball\" observations.\\nPlasma Sheet Cxossin s\\nModels of the Plasma sheet position in the dawn direction have been \\t 3\\ndeveloped to account for the Pioneer 10 outbound data (see, for example, ;Smithf+\\nat al., 1974; Goertx at al., 1976 ,Northrop at al,, 1976; itivelson at al., \\t x\\n1978). Theso,>models can now be tested against the Voyager 1 and 2 results.\\nTo simplify comparison with, experimental results, plasma sheet positions are\\n{\\nexpressed in terms of R, S, X coordinates, that is radius, latitude from the\\nJoviogrephi.c, equator and longitude X l,x (1965). The simp,^est model places theFI k J\\nplasma sheet at the dipole equator and X as a function of 6 is given by the\\nt\\'.\\nequa\\'ti.oa of a plane tilted at an angle 0 to the rotational equator:\\n-1 tan?.\\tad .cos\\ttan\\t(3\\nwhere Xd is the longitude to which the dipole points in the southernM,\\nhemisphere (20.8°.}, and $ is the dipole tilt (10.4 0)\\tX is independent or R\\ni\\t and double valued unless 8 =0. The extent of the plasma sheet depends on solar \\t {R^\\naspect and is about 40 Rd in the subsolar direction, 90 Rj at -900, 13: Rd at\\n0 l/\\n-1150, and 160 RJ at -137° from the subsolar point. This asymmetry is\\ninttodlaced by the solar wind pressure and is present in all models.\\nThis simple model (Equation 3) applies close to Jupiter; however, as the\\nI,\\ta?aserver moves further away, the values of X were found to be larger , than\\ng\\n.o....,..-_,...,e.a.;..^::..:.r....^:,.,.^.;r_.,,: _.-. .t.l.,r. p\\t ^.,,....a:_..-^..,.^..^aa.- \\t-<_w»r..^•__•.,.. t. r;a.......,.. k.___. ^.. \\t ..\\nCi\\ns\\t\\n17\\npredicted by Equation (3) This t o equivalent to an K dependent twist of the\\nplasma sheet about the rotational axis. The reason for the twist is a delay\\nrelative tole e position of the magnetic equator (Northrop at al., 1976).\\nEven If the magnetosphere were rigidly corotating, plasma moving radially away\\nfrom Jupiter would load the field lines resulting in a B3 component and field\\nsweepbaak (11111, 1950) • Since the magnetota l configuration of t1te plasma\\nsheet is much thinne r and extends to greater radial dista nces than In the\\nsubsolar hemisphe , actual radial plasma, motion has to occur when a given\\nn\\nsection of magne- sphere rotates from dusk to dawn.

These\\nfeatures were incorporated i,a the model proposed by Kivelson .\\n\\',,1M),  which\\nexpressed the delay in terms of a finite radial velocity starts $^ a\\ndisc° aco Ro.

This was the\\ngeometry of the Pioneer 10 outbound trajectory.

Figure 12 also shows that for Voyager\\nk2, double peaks persisted beyond 200 RJ, which is consistent with 60 S, as\\ndetermined from Pioneer 10. in order to determine the \"velocity\" in Equation\\n(4), we^have plotted in Figure 13 0 XIIi r Xd * cos \\'J^(taa /tan 60) for 60\\n10.40, where 0 is the angle illustrated °in Figure 11, and k--the differencer\\nbetween the longitude of maximum north excursion of the plasma sheet and Ad,\\nJ the longitude to which the dipole points in the southern hemisphere. Between\\n1 25 and 50 R J, the slope of the Voyager 1 leading crossings differs from that\\nof the lagging crossings (Table 5), and the delay was significantly longer for\\nthe leading^ than for the lagging crossings. For Voyager 2; the slopes are\\nt\\ninitially the same, but the two crossings have different delays beyond 50\\nRJ. For both missions at 100 RJ, the leading crossings were consistently\\ndelayed by 1 1/ 2 to 2 1/2 hours more than the lagging crossings. Such a\\nr\\t result is consistent with our model, but requires different values of V at the\\n\" two crossings. This led to the suggestion (Vogt et al., 1976b) that the\\naverage velocity has an azimuthal dependence which ma be associated with the\\n\"active\" and \"inactive\" hemispheres discussed by Vasyliunas (1975) and by\\nDessler (1978).\\nA different explanation for the apparent difference in delay of the two\\ncrossings is based qn the bending of the neutral sheet towards the Jovigraphic \\t j\\nequator; that is, d o becomes a function of R. Bending presumably was present\\nduring the Voyager 1 pass (Vogt, 1979x), because we often saw only one flux\\nmaximum for distances beyond 70 RJ, and did not actually cross the center of\\nthe plasma sheet (the magnetic fief did not \\'reverse, Ness et al.) 1979a),\\t lr\\n^\\t 1\\nk\"\\t 3\\nt\\n20\\nvelocities, V, for thu two crossings at a given R, Bqu,ation (4) can be solved\\nfor 60 ago (Bridge at al., 1979):\\nJ\\t1\\n6\\ttan(tan 6/ cos X) (5)\\t .0\\t 2\\nWhere AX is the difference in longitude ;hetwoen the two crossings, and 6 is\\n3\\nI\\t the spocacraft latitude. The resulting maximum-excursions of the plasma shoat\\n(Z = A tan 6 0) are shown in Figure 14 1 Only Voyager 1 data were used between\\n20 and 70 R j because the latitude of Voyager 2 was unfavorable. Beyond 60 Rj\\nthere was a distinct difference in the plasma sheet excursions between the two\\nT;\\nmissions.

The approximate neutral sheet positions shown in Figures 14 are\\nin good agreement with the results of Bridge of al.

Both Voyager 1. and 2\\ncurves start with a slope of 10.4 0, bond over at 30 R j and follow the Voyager\\nI data to 70 Rj- For Voyager 1, do is smoothly interpolated to -5.3 0 at 150\\nRj, where the maximum plasma sheet excursion°becomes tangent to the spacecraft\\nr\\ntrajectory.

The region where the disk model is valid extends from `15 KJ out to\\nabout 40 Rj in the subsolar hem apbare, to 80 KJ at 5 A.M. local time (Pioneer\\n10), 120 Rj at 4 A.M.

Ten-hour\\nmodulation of the >8 MeV electron flux in the subsolar hemisphere was observed\\nwith Voyager 2 between 40 and 60 R j (Vogt at al., 1979b). The dominant\\n►\\t magnetic field component pointed in the ~Z direction (south),;rather than\\nradial,, as in the disk region (inside 40 R j).

A g,a result, the disk model would predict that flux\\nminima should occur at a loran 1111 260 0 and a subsolar longitude,\\nA111\"240° This is based oil the dipole diroction and a 64 0 phase 1,49 at 60 Rd\\nobserved during the outbound pass (Fig. 15) ;- Although the time-of occurrence\\nis essentially the same for both models, we \\'halieve that we were observing\\nclock model modulation. because of the indications that a well-organized plasma\\nsheet did not exist in this region during the Voyager 2 ancounter°(Ness at\\nal., 1979b)\\nThy,\"clock\" model modulation was observed during the outbound passes of\\nVoyagers 1 and 2. Figure 16 shows Voyager 2 date, (1 hr• averages) on the\\tr\\nmodulation of 2.6- to 5.1-MeV and 8- to 12-MeV electron fluxes both in the\\ndisk and clock regions. Also shown is the flux \\'ratio between these two\\nchannels. As Chenette at a1. (1974) have shown, this ratio reflects more\\n1J\\naccurately the \"clock\" modulation than the total electron flux. A\\ncharacteristic feature of this modulation is a minimum in the electron flux\\nabove 6 MeV and, therefore., a periodic softening of the spectrum when\\nXjjIw240\\' is near the subsolar point. The ,left panel of Figure 16 (118-140\\nRjj ,, reflects the strong intensity modulation observed iti the disk _region.\\nNeither the flux minid nor the softest spectra occur at the predicted time,\\nand the softest spectra occur closer to flux maxima. In the right panel. of\\nFigure 16 (194-225 Rj) the intensity modulation is smaller, softer spectra are\\nobserved at minimum flux and the timing of softest spectra coincides with\\nclock model predictions. It is very significant that this future persists in \\t `\\'\\nCite magnetosheath region.

These positions can\"be compared to predictions by models of the\\nplasma sheet configuration in an attempt to gain an overall description of the\\nplama 6heat. Various interpretations based upon Voyager data have been\\npublished by Bridge et al. (1979), Carb*ry (1980), Ness et ale (1979b) $ Vogt\\net al. (1979a ,b) and Vasyliunas and Dessler (1980). Most of these authors\\nused the model described by KivelSonLet al. (1978) which involves twisting the\\ndipole equator through an angle O(R), ,around the Jovian spin axis, and the\\npossibility of beading it as a function of distance towards the Jovigtaiphic\\nequator \\t In this paper, \",^_wisted disk\" refers to a model with the\\nktplasma sheet at a constant latitude of 10-4 0, and \"bent twisted disk\" allows\\nthe latitude to decrease, as a function of distance, to values below 10-40.\\nFrom this analysis we =clude that the Voyager 2,,data, with geaerally\\n31\\ntwo crossings for each Jovion period, are consistent with both the twisted\\ndisk and beat twisted disk models. For the simple twisted disk, the angle of\\nrotation depends not only on radius but also on longitude, as first pointed\\nX/.\\'out by Vogt at al. (1979b). The implications of this model are descri id ,in\\nmore detail by Vasyliunas and Desslar (1980). Results from both mislions\\ntaken together favor the beat twisted disk not only because of the absence of\\nVoyager I neutral sheet crossings beyond 80 Rp but also because Voyager 2\\nobserved essentially the same. \\tvelocity between 30-55 R d a,t both\\ncrossings, while Voyager I found a significant difference in this region (Fig.\\n13 and Table 5). Because of the difference, between the two trajectories (Fig.\\n14) this is exactly what would be expected from a bent twisted disk In the\\nabsence of azimuthal asymmetry, BetweenR )O and 60 ►J, our results with the\\nbeat twisted disk agree with Bridge at al. (1979). Our results differ from\\nthe model identified by C ►rbary (1980) as \"Wavy XV in that the maximum plasma\\nsheet excursion in his model reaches a fixed amplitude while our results\\nrequire that tlP. maximum excursion grows as -R tan 6 0. One feature of the\\nbent twiste disk model is thatdiffereat amounts of beading are required to\\nfit data from the three missions; no or little beading was present during the\\nPioneer 10 pass, beading from 10-4 0 to 60 for Voyager 2 and to 5 0 for Voyager\\nI. Changes in the plasma loading in the magnetosphere should Af fact the\\ndeparture of the plasma sheet from the dipole equator. Since temporal changes\\nare known to occur, It is quite possible that the amount of bending was\\ndifferent for each mission.\\nA new result of our detailed analysis is tj \\nie Jinding that the wave speed\\nchanges significantly between 50 and 70 Ri (Fig. 13 and I$). This was not\\nrealized by the other investigators and explains why quite different wave\\nspeeds can be obtained depending on the exact range over which the data are\\n32\\nfit. Magnetic perturbations propag4to with the AlfYon, group velocity alon g ,9\\nfield lines, and Kivekson at al* (1978) and Carbary (1900) have equated the\\n,wave velocity discussed above with the Alfven velocity. A comparison between\\nthe wave velocities derived from the three missions and the corotation\\nvelocity Is shown in Figure 19, A general criterion for corotatiqA is.that\\nthe Alfvan velocity exceeds the corotation velocity. If taken literally)\\nFigure 19 allows that corotation should cease near 30 It j but become possible:\\nagain beyond 70 R j. However, the interpretation of 010. wave ValOCitV 48 an\\nAlfvan velocity hasivt bean firmly established, and in the model of Northrop\\nat al. (1974) no such association can be made.\\nThe bent twisted disk model accounts for the overall plasma sheet\\nL\\nlocation; however, the additional flux peaks observed by both Voyagers between\\n40 and 60 It j are difficult to explain without a XIIT dependent asymmetry.\\nSuch an asymmetry is also required by the \"clock\" modulations of electrons in\\nthe outer magnetosphere and interplanetary space.\\nThe degree of corotation of the plasma, sheet In the magnatotail is yery\\nimportant because it determines whether the Jovian plasma escapes down the\\ntail or piles up at the dawn magnetopause In a boundary layer. In the latter\\ncase) a part of this boundary layer would still escape along the tail, but a\\nsubstantial fraction should continue to rotate with Jupiter and be\\nrecompressed to form a thick boundary layer in the subsolar hemisphere. As\\nyet no consistent picture has emerged from the experimental evidence. The\\nlack of complete corotation between 20 and 45 Rj in the subsolar hemisphere\\nwas demonstrated from plasma data by McNutt at al; (1979; see also McNat and\\nDelcher, 1980). Analysis of the first order anisotropy in the energetic\\nproton flux (B > 0.S MeV) has been the other, :ma:3or source of data on\\ncorotation, However, first order anisotropies have to be corrected for flux\\nt>\\n33\\ngradients and higher order anisotropies (Northrop and Thomson 1980), resulting\\nin a significaaC reduatton in the accuracy with which the corotation velocity\\ncan be determined. On this basis McDonald at al. (1979) mound that corotation\\nwas not present beyond 70 R j in tba subsolar hemisphere (Pioneer 10). Carbary\\nat al. (1980) have interpreted their Voyager data to imply that much of the\\nmagnotosphere is relatively close to corotation, Our preliminary analysis of\\nVoyager 1 observations in the tail is consistent with corotation even at 100\\nhJ.\\nIt would appear that the degree of corotation must be subject to\\nsignificant temporal as well as spatial variations. For instance a major\\ninjection of gals from lo would significantly slow down corotation in the torus\\nregion and affect the outer magnetosphere only hater. The neutralizeti,qu of\\nions in the torus region discussed by Eviatar at al. (1976) permits oecape of\\nneutrals from the inner ma ►gnarttosphere without affecting\\' kthe outer\\nmagnetosphere CorotarRtion determines the extent to which Jupiter\\'s angular\\nmomentum is coupled to the magnetosphere and therefore plays,a key role in the\\nenergetics of the whole magnetosphere; it is particularly signikicant towards\\nunderstanding the dawn magnetosphere.\\ns\\t\\n\\t The Voyager missions confirmed the \"clock model modulation (Chenette at\\nal:, 1974) of the Jovian electron flux just outside the magneiopause and in\\nII\\nthe boundary layer. A large phase shift occurred in the 8-MeV electron flux\\nbetween the region where disk \\'model modulation dominated and,the: outer\\nregion. Surprisingly enough, the phase of the softest electron flux did not\\nchange. Softer spectral were found near maximum flux in the disk model, region\\nand near minimum flux in the clock model. region..\\nIn trying to understand the modulation of the electron flux and spectrum\\nin the boundary layer[ and magnatosheath, we \\'have assumed a `\\'substantial degree\\na\\n34\\nof corotaton. Some electrons presumably diffuse onto open field lines and\\nescape throughout the tail region; however, a major release point should be\\nnear the dawn magnetopause. In this region the corotating plasma should form\\na thick boundary layer and a relatively unstable nagnstopause. If this holds\\ntre 6 then the electron modulation can be associated with the active\\nhemisphere and, when account is taken of the propagation delay, minimum flux\\ncorresponds to a subsolar longitude, A IX, - 2400 . This type of modulation \\t j\\nE\\nclearly requires a longitudinal asymmetryo and we suggest that a region with\\nthe least amount of plasma loading would arrive; at the dawn magnetopause at\\n1\\nthe appropriate phase if a separation occurred\\' at the boundary between the\\nactive and inactive hemispheres. This should be observable as a difference in,\\nthe wave velouity\\'and May be due to a somewhat greater departure from\\ncorotati.on in the active hemisphere. Unfortunately the available data Pre\\nineonclusi.va ,,on this point, and additional observations are required in the\\nsouthern hemisphere and at more favorable longitudes.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe authors are indebted; to the Voyager magnetometer team headed by N.Fe\\nNess for permission to use their magnetic field data; R.P.

So to\\nobtain complete coverage-of one 81 M binary cycle we had to observe for at\\n1\\nleast a 5 hour .interval. The HEAO A2 + experiment (Rothschild et al. 1980)^^\\t a ^\\t Y3\\n+The A2 experiment on HEAD-1 is a collaborative effort led by E. 8aldk;of GSFCr\\nand G. Garmi,re of CIT, with collaborators at GSFC, CIT, JPL and 000.\\tL\\nmade a 6 hour pointed observation on 1978 July 19. The two detectors used\\nwere sensitive in the 2-30 keV (MED) and 2-60 (HED) energy bands. The 0.5 to\\nr\\t-4.5 keV Solid State Spectrometer (SSS, Joyce et a1. 1980) and 2-20 keV Monitor\\nProportiognl Counter (MPC) on Einstein obtained 4 tire, of data spread out over\\n2 days starting on 1979 July 15.\\nI\\t\\nIII. PERIODICITIES \\t (^\\nThe data were searched for the 81 min period using Fourier analysis \\t 1\\ntechnique=s and in each case it was detected at > 99% confidence.

This is p. \\tyreported by,Patterson p\\tp\\n(1980) because at low energies the flux becomes zero (Fipre 2). Secondly\\n}\\t there are flares in the Einstein data at N#04 and possibly -^0.2 on s\\ntimescale of order 5-10 mine The evidence we have suggest that these flares\\nare\\t t at  single events that do not persist \\tthe \\tbinary 8\\t p _ ^ \\t Y Phase from cycle Co\\ncycle.

However, while there was no\\nevidence for a coherent periodicity, there was excess power -\\'10% above then\\nexpected statistical noise for periods between 5 and 10 minutes, i.e. the\\ntimescale of the flaring behavior,\\nIW. SPECTRUM\\nThe PHA data from the SSS, M80 and. HED were fit to the standard spectral\\nmodels. The MED\\'^nd :HED were consistent with either a 2.0 photon index power\\nlaw or an,,- 18 keV thermal model. \"The SSS only fit a thermal model with kT\\n7 keV or a flat 1,0 photon index power law. 14 we assume no spectral\\nvariability betwee^p the two observations then we conclude that a thermal fit\\nof 18 keV is the correct model. In addition the MED data required a line ati\\n6.6 keV with an equivalent width of 300 eV *\\' This is consistent with thei\\nexpected line emission from a plasma in thermal equilibrium. The photon\\nspectrum obtained using the best fit parameters given in Table 1 is shown inl\\ni\\ni\\ni\\nFigure 3 for all three detectors.\\nApart from the absorption dip atthere was little evidence for Any-0.42\\ngross spectral variability across the 81 Ain modulation, although we did note\\nsome marginal evidence for a softening of the spectrum\\nBecause the \\tis weak we can \\t ^^ between ¢ 0.6 and \\'10.8.\\t not usefully uee t he\\nPHh data to define the spectrum during the dip.

A similar value \\t j\\n171s obtained from the SSS/Mk data.\\noV. DISCUSSION\\nComparison of the X-ray properties of 2AO311-227 with those in other\\nwavebands reveals the following%\\nJ. The overall-shape , and depth of modulation in the X iri&y and IR are\\nremarkably similar (Bailey et al. 1980), suggesting a common origin.4\\'\\t!\\n2. The maximum in the X-ray (and IR) occurs at the maximum of rtrculari\\npolarization and 180 0 out of phase with the linear polarization pulse (Tapia\\n1979; Bailey et a1-1980)\\nr,\\n3.. The X-ray, IR and some of the optical emission lines go into absorption\\naroundX0.42 (Verbunt et al. 1980). The optical event lasts about-three times\\nlonger than the IR and X-ray. The IR dip is similar in duration to the X- ray\\nand occurs at about the same .phase, though Bailey et a1. (1980) note 41the\\nnarrow (IR) minimum seems to be slightly variable in phase and depth from\\ncycle to cycle\".t\\t\\n_4. There is flaring (flickering) in all wavebands on a timescale of several f^\\tu\\nminutes.\\nIt is widely believed that AM Her is an accreting magnetic white dwarf\\nthat corotates with its orbital p^`riod (see Chiapetti, \\'Tanzi and Treves and\\nr\\nr\\tI\\ni8\\nrefs. therein). The similarities of the properties of 2AO311-227 to those\\'\\'of\\nAM Her has lead psople,to adapt this model to explain 2AO311-227 (Verb4nt at\\no\\na1. :1980; Schneider and Young 1980; Watson at a1. 1980; Bond at al. 1979).\\nThe X-ray properties of 2A0311-227 of a high temperature spectrum and short\\n4\\t\\n\\ttimescale flickering supports this view. We note one curious\"difference that\\nthe :iron line emission of 2AO311-227 has an equivalent Width a factor S lowerh \\nthan AH Her. The interpretation of these X-ray properties has been discussed\\nwith regard to AM Her (e.g. Tuohy at al. 1980 and refs. therein) and will not\\nbe repeated here.\\nThe coincidence of the absorption events in the optical line emission,\\nthe IR flux and the X-ray flux strongly suggests they are all caused by ao\\t0\\ncommon body of material. Because the optical lines redward of 5500 A go into\\nabsorption during this event the material must itself be responsibll, for the\\n!\\tline emission. Verbunt at al. (1980) position the emission lines in the gas\\n,,stream close to the companion star and explain the U band minimum at 90 N 0.4\\nU\\nas a self occultation by the white dwarf, pointing, the active pole away from\\nthe companion. \\'`However, because we will be looking across the gas s6^iesm, the\\nc\\t expected column density will be many orders of magni\"de below that\\nobserved. Also, this geometry incorrectly predicts an X-ray minimum\\nofm0.4. Watson et al. (1980) require the dip to be the result of an 9\\noccultation by the atmosphere of the, .companion star, which in turn means the\\nemission lines originate from the stars atmosphere. This conflicts with the\\nx\\t result of Schneider and Young (1980) who show the velocities of the lines,\\n\\'\\t infer that they are formed in material falling freely onto the white dwarf.\\n^ We suggest that the X -ray absorption event is caused by the accretion\\ncolumn at the magnetic pole of the white dwarf passing through our line of0\\nsight. A large part of the IR and optical flux probably comes from the\\n4\\n ,\\ncyclotron radiation of a high temperature plasma contained in a 10 6-10$ G3\\nmagnetic field (e.g. Lamb and Masters 1980). \\tThe,ltnear polarisation pulse\\noccurov when the field lines are perpendicular to the observer and tree ?araday\\neffect is minimal (Stockman 1977 )0\\tConversly the maximum of the circular\\n\"\\t polarisation will occur When we are viewing along the :field lines. \\tThis\\nprovides a natural explanation for the IR and X-ray modulations as\\na cos8 effect (Rasko and ; Syunyaev 1976) 1.e, during the ii^ear polarization\\npulse we are viewing at an oblique angle to the emission region and hence see\\na minimum. \\tFor the accretion column to get in the way in the observed manner\\nthe system inclination must be to first order\\'\\'- 450, with A similar\\n\\'\\t declinuton,for the magnetic pole. \"Thus 1800 after the polarization pulse we s\\nwill view directly along the magnetic dipole., We can make an order of\\nmagnitude calculation for the expected absorption in the column. \\tThe radius A\\nk\\t of the column must increase zwith height R move the star and for a magnetic -\\t1\\ndipole A will be approximately proportional\\'to Rl\\'\\'50\\t\"aecause of the 90% of\\n^) the X-r ay absor ti ps will occur within three stellar radi of the white„p\\n-\\t dwarf.\\tThe duration of the dip yields a radius for the accretion column at\\nits base of \\t800 km.\\tAn X-rav\\'\\'`luminosity of 10 52ergs s\\tgives an A of\\n10-13 Mn yr\\'1 and integrating out along the column predicts a column density\\nof about 2 x 10 22 R atoms cm,2\\tsimilar to our observed value., \\tThe optical\\n\\'\\t event is three times longer than the X-ray which indicates the optical y`°\\nemission comes from higher up,in,the column (-0.3 R o).\\tThe lack of any major,\\nQ,\\nphase lag between, the three absorption events suggests that the column and\\n\\'hence the pole to first orderpoints towards the companion star.\\tAs the U\\nI.\\tband \"nations probably arise from X -ray heating,of\\'the companion, then the\\nfact thai they are o(in anti-phase with the IR supports°this orientation.\\nClearly this model is only a \"blue, bones\" description of the system to\\no\\n`^\\na\\naccount for the grope properties. for instance some sort of asymmetry is\\nE\\t\\n\\t inferred by the fact that the absorption dip occurs slightly earlier in phase\\nthan the expected 4 0.5, Also, such more detailed modelling will bwzraquired\\nto explain the complexities of the visual .light curve: „Honathwlos,s we are\\n7\\nfortunate that nature has aligned things such that the accretion column passes \\trj\\nin front of the X-ray source, Future measurements of 2AO311-227 will be able\\nto utilize this as a probe to deconvolve the location of the various emission\\n\\'\\t regions and to build up a better understanding of the accretion column itself.\\nI thank^tean Swank for discussions and all the people \\'at GSFC past and7;\\npresent who have made indirect contributions to this work.\\n\\'p\\t _\\n`\"\\'\\nRLFERENCGS\\nBailey, J., Hough, J.M., Axon, D.J. 1980, Mature 295 306.\\nBasko, M.M. and Syunyaev, A.A. 1976 ► Sov.

These projects are to demonstrate in the field that photovoltaic power systems are suitable and ready for specific near-term applications such as village power systems, water pumping, irrigation, refrigeration of medicines and food, and lighting. Since 1976, NASA Lewis has installed over 35 solar photovoltaic power systems for various applications and power levels ranging from about 50 watts to several kilowatts. (The solar photovoltaic conversion process uses the photovoltaic effect in solid-state devices (solar cells) to convert solar energy directly into electricity, with no moving parts.) Figure 7 shows some of the applications that Lewis is responsible for. The System Test Facility, located at Lewis, is used to test solar arrays and solar photovoltaic systems before they are placed in the field. Also shown is the world\\'s first village solar photovoltaic power system, which was installed by NASA Lewis in November 1978 at the \\nPapago \\nIndian village of Schuchuli, Arizona. This 3.5-kilowatt system supplies power for lighting, refrigeration, and water pumping for about 95 Indians who reside there. A 1 \\n.&kilowatt \\nsystem (as part of our AID project) was installed in December 1978 at a village in Upper Volta, Africa, to supply power to grind grain and pump water. The fire lookout tower in \\nLassen \\nNational Forest and the highway dust sign have been operating since early 1977. There is more discussion of solar photovoltaics in the paper by \\nR. G. Forney and J. N. Deyo. As some of you are aware, Public Law \\n95-620 requires that most Federal installations stop using petroleum and natural gas by 1990. Also, in all probability, many utilities currently using petroleum will switch to coal. At NASA Lewis we are developing technology along with industry for the use of coal to fuel coal-fired fuel cells, MHD generators, and turbines (fig. 8). Fuel cell systems offer attractive features for commercialization because they have high efficiency at full or part load, they are clean and quiet, they provide heat and electricity, and their modularity permits multikilowatt to multimegawatt power levels. MHD\\'s chief attributes are that it offers the potential of an environmentally acceptable approach to using our abundant coal resources to produce electric power at very high efficiency \\n(e.g., \\na potential 50 percent improvement over current steam plants) and attractive costs. The heat engine effort is directed toward advancing the technology for gas turbines, \\nFigure 7 \\nFigure 8 \\nBEDOXEN GE =_ \\nC_80_2_7\\nFigure9\\nMHDENG:iNEER|NGTESTFAC|LITY _;_:_\\nh:\\nii\\n POWERTRAINAND \\nMAGNET\\nFigure10\\n\\nsothattheycanbeusedwithcoalorcoal-derived fuels.Theobjectives ofthesethreeprojects are \\n(1)Forfuelcells--to develop commercially viablephosphoric acidfuel-cell systems forelectric \\nutilitypowergeneration andon-site/integrated energysystems forresidential, commercial, and \\nindustrial applications. \\n(2)Formagnetohydrodynamics (MHD)--to develop advanced MHDpowertraintechnology and \\ntodefinethedesignofacommercial prototype plant(engineering testfacility) directed toward \\ndetermining thecommercial viability ofcoal-fired MHDpowerplants havingpotential forhighplant \\nefficiency andlowcostofelectricity. \\n(3)Forheatengines--to dosystemstudiesandtodevelop near-term combustion andmaterials \\ntechnology forturbine powerplants inordertoshiftfromnatural gasandoiltocoalandcoal-derived \\nfuels.Figure9showsanon-sitecommercial application forafuelcell,andfigure10showstheMHD \\nengineering testfacility thatisplanned todemonstrate thefeasibility ofMHDforautility \\napplication.

Mechanical failures occureither \\nbecause thestresses andstrainsaretoohigh,orbecause theparthasaregionofunintentionally low \\nweakness.

And,basedonthose \\nmodes, onecanthencalculate asafedesignlifetime. \\nIntheareaofstructural analysis Lewisisbothauserandadeveloper offinite-element computer \\nprograms.

NASTRAN has,ofcourse, beenusedin \\ncountless otherapplications overtheyearsincluding thedesigning ofcomposite structures, \\nautomotive bodies, etc. \\nNowletusexamine, briefly, howmaterials failingasturbine engines. Fatigue crackinitiation, \\npropagation, andultimate fracture resultfromtheapplication ofcyclicstressandstrain. Fatigue \\ncracksinitiate atlocalized microscopic inhomogeneities inthematerial. Continued cycling causesthe \\ncracktogrowandpropagate deeper anddeeper untilacritical lengthisreached andcatastrophic \\nfracture suddenly occurs. Creeprupture isahightemperature failure mode. Creeprupture occurs \\nwhenasubstantial loadisapplied toamaterial. Thermally activated diffusion mechansims causethe \\n54\\n\\nmaterial tostretch; thatis,itcreeps,untilitthinsdownorcrackstothepointwhereitcannolonger \\ncarrytheapplied load.Arapidlyrotating turbineblade,forexample, issubjected tocreepduetothe \\nhighcentrifugal loadsathighengineoperating temperatures. Environmental attackisalsoaserious \\nfailuremodeathightemperatures. Here,theelements inthegasturbine environment combine \\nchemically withthemetallic surface toformundesirable products. Thisdepletes thematerial of \\nstrengthening elements, and,because thecross-sectional dimensions aredecreased asthedepthof \\nattackproceeds, theavailable load-bearing areacanbesubstantially reduced. Finally, wegettoa \\nprevalent failuremodeingasturbine engines, andonewhichishighlycomplicated because itcomes \\naboutasaconsequence ofthesimultaneous actionoffatigue, creep,andenvironmental attack.This \\ncombination ofattackmodesiscalledthermal fatigue. Thecyclicaction,whichisassociated withthe \\nfatiguecontribution, isimposed bythestart-stop, heat-up-cool-down operation ofanengine. The \\ndifferential expansion produced bytemperature gradients withinamaterial causesself-imposed \\ncyclicstresses andstrains. Thermal fatigue cracking orheatcrazing isalsoencountered insuch \\ndiversesituations ashightemperature forging dies,andautomotive exhaust valves. \\nOnceweknowhowmaterials fail,wemustthenbecome quantitative andcalculate howlongitwill \\ntakebeforefailureoccurs. Eachofthefailuremodesdescribed intheprevious figurehasbeen \\naddressed byLewisengineers, andnumerous life-prediction methods havebeendeveloped. Arather \\nsimplebuthighlyusefulmethod, calledthemethod ofuniversal slopes,hasbeendeveloped atLewis \\n(ref.14)toestimate material fatigue crackinitiation resistance. Thismethod canbeusedwithout \\nhavingtoconduct asinglefatiguetest.Therequired inputcomesfromtheproperties measured ina \\ntensiletest.Therequired properties aretheductility, D(basedonreduction ofarea),whichgoverns \\nlowcyclefatigue resistance intherangefrom1toabout1000cyclestofailure, andtheultimate \\ntensilestrength, Ou,andthemodulus ofelasticity, E,whichgovernthelife,Nf,inthe1000to1 \\nmillioncyclestofailurerange.Theequation ofuniversal slopesrelatesthecyclictotalstrainrange, \\nAe,tothefatiguelife,Nf,asshown, \\nAe=3.5EauNf-0.12+DO.6Nf-O.6 \\nThechiefadvantage ofthemethod isitslowcost,and,infact,handbook valuesoftensileproperties \\ncanbeusedtoestimate fatigueproperties intheearlystagesofdesign.Theaccuracy isapproximately \\nplusorminusafactoroffiveinlife.Thisisusually considered acceptable considering thelarge \\ndegreeofscatterassociated withtheinhomogeneous fatigueprocess. \\nLewisengineers havealsomadeimportant contributions intheareaofdescribing andpredicting \\nthelifetime ofmaterials containing fatiguecracksorflaws,thatis,thetimethematerial canbeused \\nbeforecatastrophic failureresults. Thisareaiscalledfracture mechanics. AtLewiswehavederived \\naccurate equations (refs.15to17)forthestressfieldsurrounding thetipsofcracksinloaded \\nstructures. Wehavealsocontributed tothedevelopment ofnewcalculational techniques (ref.18). \\nThequantity usedtodescribe thestressfieldaround acrackiscalledthestressintensity factor,KI, \\nwhichisusedtorelatetheapplied load,cracklength,andothergeometric factorsthatcontribute to \\nthecracktipstresses. Wehaveapplied fracture mechanics concepts topredicttherateofcycliccrack \\npropagation inaerospace structural components (ref.19).Theprimary purpose istocalculate the \\nremaining safelifetime available toanypartbeforeitmustberemoved fromservice. Finally, Lewis, \\ninconjunction withotherresearch organizations andtheAmerican Society forTesting and \\nMaterials, hascontributed significantly toward thedevelopment ofstandardized tests(ref.20)for \\nmeasuring thefracture toughness KIcofcracked materials. \\nSeveral approaches havebeendeveloped atLewisforpredicting thelifetime ofmaterials usedat \\nhighoperating temperatures. Anexample oftheseisthetime-temperature computer program called \\nMEGA (ref.21).MEGA isthemostrecentofalonglineoftime-temperature-creep-rupture \\nparameters thatweandothershavedeveloped.

Thecoating material generally hasmarkedly different mechanical \\nproperties fromthesubstrate, andthesedifferences causeconsiderable stressattheinterface. Asa \\nconsequence, theinterface isweakandthecoating easilyfractures orfallsoffthesubstrate. \\nResearchers hereatLewis,aswellasatanumber ofotherplaces,areexploring waysofimproving \\ntheadhesion ofthehard-face coating tothesubstrate. Onetechnique thatwehavedeveloped isthe \\nuseofaninterfacial ortransition layerbetween thesubstrate andthecoating. Onesuitable transition \\nlayermaterial wasdiscovered tobeordinary oxides. Abuildup ofselected oxidesonthesubstrate \\nsurface beforeapplying ahard-face coating (e.g.,refractory metalcarbides suchasmolybdenum, \\ntungsten, titanium) improves adhesion considerably. \\nNowthisisjusttheopposite ofwhatwediscussed earlier.

(The same thing is true with the boride and silicide, except one sees different oxide compositions.) What the oxides do, then, is key the coating material to the oxide and then the oxide to the substrate, thereby promoting good adhesion of the coating material to the substrate. We have since found that other materials can be used to achieve the same type of bonding. For example, a layer of pure titanium metal sputter-deposited between the titani~~alloy substrate and the coating material bonds very strongly to the oxide of a titanium-base alloy substrate and, for example, very strongly to the carbon of a carbide coating. Recactive gases, such as acetylene, can also be usd to promote the formation of interfacial carbides. These carbides perform the same keying function as oxides, in that they promote the adhesion of the hard, refractory coatings to the substrate. \\nConclusions \\nSputtering and ion-plating are very useful techniques for applying dense, tenacious films to a variety of surfaces. The distinct advantage of the ion-plating process is the diffuse, or graded, interface it produces; that of sputtering is the wide variety of coating materials that can be deposited on a wide variety of substrates. Both processes have applications in a number of areas, including a catalytic corrosion, protective, decorative and lubrication films. \\nSelf-Lubricating Composite Materials \\nHarold E.Sliney \\nNational Aeronautics andSpaceAdministration \\nLewisResearch Center \\nCleveland, Ohio \\nTheproperties thatareofprimary interest instructural composites areadequate mechanical \\nstrength andcorrosion resistance.

Theeconomy ofmolding thepolyimides \\ncouldbegreatlyimproved bythedevelopment ofahigh-temperature injection molding process for \\nthisclassofpolymers. \\nAnessential characteristic ofself-lubricating composites isthattheyarenongalling; thematerial \\nmustnotonlyhaveanadequately lowwearratebutthewearsurfaces thataregenerated musthavean \\nacceptable topogrophy.

Ineitherconcept thecoalisintimately mixedwitha \\nsorbent--usually limestone fortheatmospheric fluidized bed.Thecoalisdesulfurized directly inthe \\nfluidized bed,withtheresultant formation ofcalcium sulfate. Thisapproach requires materials \\nhandling oflimestone aswellascoalasfeedstock andhandling ofashandspentsorbent aswaste \\nproducts. Thiscombination ofwasteproducts mustberemoved fromthesiteandpermanently \\ndisposed of. \\nFluegasdesulfurization hasbeenadopted bymanyutilities withvarying degrees ofsuccess. With \\nhigh-sulfur coalthestackorfluegases--products ofcombustion containing sulfuroxides--are \\nscrubbed withwaterandasorbent toformasludgewasteproduct. Thisapproach typically exhibits \\nproblems ofreduced reliability andavailability, increased wateruse,increased energyuse,and \\ndifficulty inhandling anddisposing ofsludgewastes. Inaddition, thescrubbers areasignificant \\nparasitic electric loadthatdegrades overallpowerplant efficiency. \\nOtherapproaches forhigh-sulfur-coal usearebeingstudied butarenotyetcommercialized. A \\npromising approach iscoalbenefication--a technique thatprecleans and/or pretreats thecoalto \\ninsureenvironmental acceptance ofthecombustion products. \\nGasification istheapproach thatisunderconsideration forapplication attheNASALewissite. \\nTherationale forthisselection isasfollows: Itistheonlyprocess thatcanusehigh-sulfur coalwith \\nproven, commercially available acid-gas-remova !cleanup techniques. Inaddition, sincegasification \\nrequires onlypartialcombustion, theconsequent removal of\\'acidgas(hydrogen sulfide) involves \\nitreatment ofonlyasmallfraction ofthevolume thatwouldbetreatedbyfluegasdesulfurization \\nmethods. Undersomeconditions thisfraction isaslowas1percent. \\nSomegasification techniques havethepotential foraccepting awidevarietyofcoaltypesand \\nqualities. Thisisparticularly important forsmallcoaluserswhomayhavetobuyonthespotmarket. \\nWaste-handling problems areminimized because thelowproduct volumes (ashandelemental sulfur) \\naresuitable fordirectlandfill use.Alsothereisgood potential forachieving gaseous fuelemission \\nstandards, ratherthansolid(coal)fuelstandards. Thisisduetotheneedforparticulate andsulfur \\ncleanup beforegasturbine combustion tominimize corrosion intheturbinehotsection. Also,when \\nlow-Btu gasisburned, theproducts ofcombusti0n--specifically oxidesofnitrogen--are wellwithin \\nthenew-source stationary emission standards without additional treatment techniques. \\nThepotential forhighelectrical conversion efficiency existswhengasification isintegrated witha \\ncombined-cycle powerplant.

Site location, plant size, and electric power demand were considered in criteria developed for screening and selecting candidates that could use a wide variety of coals, including that from Ohio. A fluidized bed gasifier concept was chosen as the baseline design and key components of the powerplant were technically assessed. No barriers to environmental acceptability are foreseen.

Wasteproducts must \\nbedisposable without treatment atreasonable costandwithminimum handling andlogistics. \\nApproaches forUseofHigh-Sulfur Coal \\nThereareanumber ofapproaches thatcanbeconsidered fortheuseofhigh-sulfur coal. \\nAtmospheric fluidized-bed combustion iscurrently beingusedinsomeapplications. Pressurized \\nfluidized bedshavenotyetbeencommercialized. Ineitherconcept thecoalisintimately mixedwitha \\nsorbent--usually limestone fortheatmospheric fluidized bed.Thecoalisdesulfurized directly inthe \\nfluidized bed,withtheresultant formation ofcalcium sulfate. Thisapproach requires materials \\nhandling oflimestone aswellascoalasfeedstock andhandling ofashandspentsorbent aswaste \\nproducts. Thiscombination ofwasteproducts mustberemoved fromthesiteandpermanently \\ndisposed of. \\nFluegasdesulfurization hasbeenadopted bymanyutilities withvarying degrees ofsuccess. With \\nhigh-sulfur coalthestackorfluegases--products ofcombustion containing sulfuroxides--are \\nscrubbed withwaterandasorbent toformasludgewasteproduct. Thisapproach typically exhibits \\nproblems ofreduced reliability andavailability, increased wateruse,increased energyuse,and \\ndifficulty inhandling anddisposing ofsludgewastes. Inaddition, thescrubbers areasignificant \\nparasitic electric loadthatdegrades overallpowerplant efficiency. \\nOtherapproaches forhigh-sulfur-coal usearebeingstudied butarenotyetcommercialized. A \\npromising approach iscoalbenefication--a technique thatprecleans and/or pretreats thecoalto \\ninsureenvironmental acceptance ofthecombustion products. \\nGasification istheapproach thatisunderconsideration forapplication attheNASALewissite. \\nTherationale forthisselection isasfollows: Itistheonlyprocess thatcanusehigh-sulfur coalwith \\nproven, commercially available acid-gas-remova !cleanup techniques. Inaddition, sincegasification \\nrequires onlypartialcombustion, theconsequent removal of\\'acidgas(hydrogen sulfide) involves \\nitreatment ofonlyasmallfraction ofthevolume thatwouldbetreatedbyfluegasdesulfurization \\nmethods. Undersomeconditions thisfraction isaslowas1percent. \\nSomegasification techniques havethepotential foraccepting awidevarietyofcoaltypesand \\nqualities. Thisisparticularly important forsmallcoaluserswhomayhavetobuyonthespotmarket. \\nWaste-handling problems areminimized because thelowproduct volumes (ashandelemental sulfur) \\naresuitable fordirectlandfill use.Alsothereisgood potential forachieving gaseous fuelemission \\nstandards, ratherthansolid(coal)fuelstandards. Thisisduetotheneedforparticulate andsulfur \\ncleanup beforegasturbine combustion tominimize corrosion intheturbinehotsection. Also,when \\nlow-Btu gasisburned, theproducts ofcombusti0n--specifically oxidesofnitrogen--are wellwithin \\nthenew-source stationary emission standards without additional treatment techniques. \\nThepotential forhighelectrical conversion efficiency existswhengasification isintegrated witha \\ncombined-cycle powerplant.

Stum*aary of Principal Experimental Results\\n2.1 Presentation of Test Material\\nFor this study, carried out in close collaboration by the\\n*Numbers in margin indichte pagination in the foreign text.V,\\n1\\nAeordynami.cs and Structural Resistance departments of ONRRA, the\\nselected airfoil is a ^,upeYcritical airfoil of 16 relative thickness,\\ndeveloped by the A grospatiale company (airfoil RA 16 SC 1),\\nThe two-dimensional model has a chord of 180 mm. The control\\nsurface of the trailing edge, involving 25% of the chord, is activated\\nby two small rotary hydraulic actuators controlled by synchronized\\nservo-valves and driven by a sinusoidal signal generator. This system\\nmakes it possible to obtain oscillations of the control surface of\\n+ 10 at 100 Hz, the amplitude reaching + 50 at 20 Hz (figure 1).\\nThe model is equipped with 78 static pressure gauges and 32\\nKulite short response time unsteady pressure gauges.\\nThe test took place in the S3 iigustn wand tunnel at Modane,\\nat Mach numbers between 0,3 and 0.8. The test program comprises a\\nsteady and an unsteady segment, with study of the influence of numerous\\nparameters. The treatment of the signal collected by the Kulite gauges\\nduring the dynamic test is detailed in Figure 2.\\nFinally, a strioscopy bench made it possible to film the\\nmovement of the extrados shock wave in transonic mode.\\n2.2 Steady Characteristics of the Airfoil\\nAt zero incidence and zero flap angle, a supersonic zone\\nappears at the extrados trailing edge in the vicinity of MOD\\t0.7\\n(Figure 3). As the Mach number increases, this supersonic zone rapidly\\nextends downstream, giving a distribution of pressure in the form of a\\nplateau with a rather weak shock, and the intrados in its turn becomes\\nsupersonic.\\nThe appearance of the supersonic zones is profoundly altered\\nby the angling of the flap (Figure 4) , but, as the airfoil is heavily /19-4\\nloaded towards the rear because of its design (Figure 3), the control\\nsurface remains positively loaded in most cases, the load on the controlW\\n2\\nsurface being cancelled only for a flap angle in the neighborhood of\\n0-10\\n2.3 Unsteady Characteristics of the Airfoil\\nThe various coefficients of unsteady pressure, lift, moment\\nof pitch and moment of hinge are presented in the form of the modulus\\nand phase of the first harmonic ( w term of the Fourier series). This\\nmode of presentation is justified by the experiment, the harmonics of\\nthe higher order being negligible except very locally for pressure\\nsignals in the narrow zones swept by the shocks, The phases are deter-\\nmined in relation, to the position of the control surface and the extrados\\npressure phases are presented with an interval of 180 0; this would make\\nit possible to obtain the same phase curve for the intrados and extrados\\nin the case of a symmetrical airfoil at zero incidence with a control\\nsurface oscillating around a zero flap angle; here this will. demon-\\nstrate the effect of the dissymetry of the airfoil which was used.\\nInfluence of the Mach Number\\nFirst we note the importance of theinfluence of the Mach\\nnumber on the distribution of the unsteady pressure coefficients for\\nthe saute reduced frequency (Figure 5). In subcritical regime the curve\\nof the Cp I moduli shows the classic appearance anticipated in the plane\\nplate theory (maxima at the leading edge and at the hinge corresponding\\nto the infinite values of the theory), the phase evolving in almost\\nlinear fashion from a lag at the leading edge to a lead at the flap.\\nAs the Mach number increases, a supersonic zone forms, termin-\\nating in a shock of variable intensity. The oscillations of this shock\\nare reflected on the curve of the moduli by a peak whose intensity\\ndepends on that of the shock. The level of pressure fluctuations\\nupstream from the shock, that is, in the supersonic flow zone, dimin-\\nishes as the Mach number increases.\\nThe difference in phase increases with the Mach number at the\\nleading edge, but it maintains an almost steady level in the supersonic\\n1\\t .3\\nkilo\\nzone and shows an abrupt leap at the level of the shock.\\nThe appearance of the unsteady pressure distributions is thus\\nvery different depending on whether we are in subcritical regime, with-\\nout shocks, or in supercritical regime, with shocks,\\n,Influence of the Reduced Frequency\\nThe influence of the reduced frequency, moreover, is reflected\\nsomewhat differently in the two cases, In suberitical regime, the\\nmodulus of pressure diminishes and the phase lag at the leading ed-e\\ngrows as the reduced frequency increases, the zero phase joint being\\ndisplaced upstream (Figure 6). In supercritical regime, while the\\nphase lag in the supersonic zone increases with the reduced frequency,\\nthe unsteady pressure moduli, in contrast, evolve in the opposite\\ndirection on either side of the shock (Figure 7).\\nSteady-Unsteady Interactions\\nContrary to the results anticipated by the linear theory, \\t/19-4\\nthere is significant interaction of the average characteristics of the\\nflow on its unsteady characteristics, This interaction is well illus-\\ntrated by the effect of average angle of the flap on the unsteady\\npressures (Figures 8 and 9). When the average angle of the flap in-\\ncreases, thus increasing the average load on the wing and on the con*\\ntrot surface, the moduli of the unsteady pressures diminish, and the\\nphases evolve slightly in the direction of a phase lead. However, a\\nstrong increase in unsteady pressures at the trailing edge appears\\nwhen the flap oscillates increasingly near breakaway (b m = 2.5 in\\nthe present case). In supers ritical regime (Figure 9) to an increasing\\ndegree, we observe translation of the peal-, of the curve of moduli and\\nof the jump in the phase curve corresponding to the displacement of\\nthe average position of the shock. \\t /19-5\\n3. Comparisons between Experimental and Computed Results\\n3.1 Presentation of Methods of Computation\\nEach of the methods of computation used will be briefly.\\npresented, For more detail, refer to the works quoted as references.\\na) Methods Based on the Hypothesis of Potential Flows\\nSteady Flows\\nThe programs which are available use the GARABEDIAN\\nand KORN method:-to forecast steady flows in inviscid fluid in super-\\ncritical regime. The effects of viscosity are taken into account by\\npairing with a boundary layer calculation, with pairing technique con-\\nsisting of computing tt*Le inviscid flow around the airfoil, enlarged by\\nthe thickness of displacement of the boundary layer (2.3).\\nUnsteady , Flows in Inviscid Fluids, Suberitical\\nTo deal with unsteady flows in the entire subcritical\\narea , we can use the linear- plane plate theory. This method, current-\\nly used in structural calculations by ONERA, i \\xad a doublet method (4):\\nthe airfoil is assimilated into a line without thickness or curve and\\nbroken down into about twenty elements, each comprising a doublet\\nof the acceleration potential of the forward 1/4. The conditions of\\ntangency of the flow are applied to the rear 1/4 of each element. This\\nmethod is, however, of limited use, as it does not take into account\\nthe influence of the average flow in the unsteady response, an influence\\nwhich is significant in heavily loaded configurations.\\nTo represent the influence of the average flow on the\\nunsteady response at low speeds, we have at our disposal a program for\\ncomputing incompressible unsteady flow, developed by the Bertin company\\n(5) and based on the GEISING method (6). The airfoil is represented by\\nsurfaces and recesses along its contours and eddies on the median line.\\nThe wake is composed of free eudies emitted at each time increment to\\npreserve the total circulation of the f low. This method takes into\\naccount the exact form and movement of the airfoil, as well as the\\ndeformation of the eddying wake.\\nUnsteady Flow in Inviscid Fluid, Supercritical Regime:\\n5\\nIn order to deal with unsteady flows in supere ritical\\nregime, we currently use a computation program solving, by a method\\nof finite differences, the equation for speed potentials with the\\nappsoximation of small disturbances for transonic, two-dimensional\\nunsteady flow, This program, initially developed for the study of\\nflow over helicopter blades by F.X, Caradonna (7), was adapted to suit\\noscillating flaps by J,J. THIBERT of ONERA, There is also another\\nmethod for small transonic disturbances being developed by the Struc-\\ntural Resistance department of ONERA (8) and which has the advantage\\nof requiring a shorter computation time than does the CARADONNA program.\\nb) Solution of Euler Equations\\nThe hypothesis of small disturbances is not very realis-\\ntic for a 16% airfoil comprising supersonic zones, sometimes extensive,\\nfor an upstream infinite Mach number of the order of 0.73 to 0.75, and\\nit is quite difficult to know what terms can be ignored in the poten-\\ntial equations.\\nTo evaluate error due to the small transonic distur-\\nbances hypothesis, we will refer to a method for computing steady flow\\nin inviscid fluids solving the Euler equations (9). This method makes\\nit possible to compute, for an airfoil of a given thickness, super-\\ncritical flows, without restrictions on the intensity and movement of\\nshocks. The inviscid flow around an airfoil with an oscillating flap\\nis calculated by solving the complete Euler equations, in the form of\\nintegral laws of conservation, ,, by the \"finite volumes\" method general-\\nized as a. mobile Lattice. The method is conservative, in the sense\\nthat in a numerical evaluation of mass or quantity of movement or of\\nenergy in a field made up of cells, the contributions of the internal\\nflows intervening in the numerical diagram cancel each other out in\\npairs. The condition of sideslipping \\tis imposed on the oscillating\\nflap in its exact position over time.\\nThe main disadvantage of this ;ast method, which is of\\n6\\nthe type which is explicit in its present form, is the length of time\\nrequired for computation.\\nThis method was tested and perfected by a NACA 0012\\nairfoil with oscillating flap (9), but it was only possible to carry\\nout two steady flow calculations with the RA 16 SCI airfol.1 in time to\\ninclude them in this article, Unsteady flow calculations are in progress,\\nc) TakinginLo Account Unsteady Viscous Effects\\nIn order to take into account unsteady viscous effects,\\nwe carried out a pairing of a method of computation for inviscid fluids\\nwith a program for computation of unsteady ^:urbulent boundary layer,\\nsimultaneously with incompressible flow, using the BERTIN program,\\nand transonic flow, with the C,, .ADONNA program.\\nAll the results presented in this report were obtained4M\\nwith an integral method for calculating the turbulent: boundary layer\\nin unsteady compressible flow, developed at CERT (10). This method\\nuses the Karman equation (conservation of quantities of motion) and\\nthe equation \\' of entrainment established for unsteady flow, the added\\nrelationships required to solve the system of equations being the same\\nas those used for steady flow,\\nWhether for incompressible or transonic flow, the method\\nof pairing consists of making the inviscid fluid calculation with a\\nmodification of the limiting conditions on the airfoil to take into\\naccount the development of the boundary layer. In concrete terms, this\\nmeans a flow of fluid across the wall \\t characterized by normal\\nspeed vt in the BERTIN program, and by a modification of the local\\nslopes of the airfoil of quantity \\t the CARADONNA program, ve\\nand V^,), are given by the relationship:\\n\\'Lre\\t(V ) \\np - I\\tL (^,: tiA\\nitlt\\n7\\nwherebi is the thiekness of displacement, t 4v the tangentlal speed \\t/19-6\\nof inviscid flow and t. the volum\\'Anal mass.\\nThis relationship is dentiCal to that given by J,C,\\nLEBALLEUR for steady flows (11); in fact, the pairing relationship\\nat the\\twall causes\\n4\\nto appear as the single unsteady term which has been ignored even in\\ncompressible flow.\\nFor eacii time interval, two or Lhrec iterations for\\ninviscid fluid-boitndary layer are carried out:, with, if necessary, the\\nuse of a relaxation method,\\nThe main problems encountered in pairing are essentially\\nlinked to the appearance of breakaway at the trailing edge, at the\\nhinge and in the presence of shocks of significant intensity. The\\nshock wave-boundary layer interactions and breakaway are treated in a\\nsimplified manner, and it is obvious that the pairing technique is only\\nusable in the case of weak shock wave-boundary layer interaction and\\nsmall breakaway zones.\\n3.2 Comparisons in Steady Flow\\nFigures 10 and 11 correspond to two control surface angles,\\nFor each angle, steady pressures measured with a guided jet were brought\\nto X o,* = 7,3 and calculations carried out for inviscid fluids with\\nthe potential method and with the Euler equations. These computations\\nwere carried out with the Mach number and incidence corrected for wall\\nAnterferenoe \\t these correctionsbeing quite well known for guided\\njuts. The two methods of calculation give fairly similar results, with\\na shock much farther downstream than in the experimental results, for\\nthe extrados. The shock calculated using the Euler equations is always\\n8\\na little farther downstream than that computed using the potential\\nmethod.\\nFrom, the results presented 1A Figures 10 a,id 11, we drew\\nexperimental and theoretical quasi-steady values for the unsteady\\npressure coeEficients; these values correspond to oscillation of the\\ncontrol surface at zero frequency with an amplitude of + 0,590 around\\nthe average angle bm -1. 070 (Figure 12) \\tThey are obtained as\\nfollows#\\nCPQS\\nThe peak due to the rtiqplaoement of the shock is still much farther\\ndownstream in invis -d fluid theories r t\"han in the experiment, the one\\ngiven by the Euler equations being slightly farther downstream than.\\nthat given by the potantial theory. The two theories given very similar\\nre-,ults upstream from the shock ) but on the other hand, they differ\\nsharply downstream from the shock and on the flap.\\nIn figures 13 to 15, which correspond to three control sur-\\nface angles, the experimental steady pressures are presented along with\\nthose calculated using the potential theory with and without boundar-,\\nlayer (2 3)\\nThe agreement between the experiment and the theory with \\t /19-8\\nboundary layer is relatively good, except, perhaps, immediately down-\\nstream from the shock, where the theory often indicates a reac-celera-\\ntion which is not found experimentally, and on the extrados of the\\nflap, where computations diverge notably from the experimental results.\\nTo explain these discrepancies, it must be noted that the\\nshock wave boundary layer interaction is treated in a simplified manner\\n9\\nin the computation, and that there may exist a draft effect through\\nthe slit between the wing and the control surface which cannot be\\ntaken into a-,. ,count in computation. In addition, in the three selected\\nconfigurations, computations did not always converge very successfully\\nand almost always indicated breakaway on the control surface, which\\nlimits the val.idity of the results,\\nWe also compared the experimental quasi-steady values with\\nthe values given by the potential flow theory, with and without boundary\\nlayer (Figure 16) in the same situation as in Figure 12,\\nWe noted a certain dispersal of experimental quasi-stationary\\nvalues for the in ,-.rados, as they are obtained by differences in Kp\\nwhich have very similar values,\\nFigure 16 shows the advantage of the computation with. bound-\\nary layer, in particular in order to position. the shock displacement\\npuak, correctly, But the part downstream from the extrados shock,\\nespeieally on the flap, is still rather poorly predicted by the theory\\nusing the boundary layer, It is therefore most important to improve\\nthe treatment of the shcoi r. wave - boundary layer interaction, and of\\nbreakaway,\\n3.3 Com2arisons in Unsteady Flow\\n3.3.1 Subaritical Zone\\nAt low Mach numbers, the linearization theory predicts\\nthe development of unsteady pressures along the chord with fair suc-\\ncess (figure 17), but it does not differentiate between the extrados\\nand the intrados because it does not take into account the effects of\\nthe average flow on the unsteady flow, so that its use is limited to\\nlightly loaded configurations, In this case, it benefits from a fortun-\\nate compensation between the effects of thickness and curvature on one\\nhand and viscosity on the other, effects which are already acting ini\\n10\\nT\\nthe opposite direction in quasi-steady mode (12). \\t /19-9\\nIt will be noticed that this linear theory gives\\ninfinite unsteady pressures at the leading edge and at the hinge,\\nIn Figure 18, one of the experimental cases presented\\nwith the linear theory in Figure 17 is compared with the results of\\nthe Bertin company\\'s program for invisaid flow computation with and\\nwithout pairing with a computation for unsteady turbulent boundary\\nlayer. The inviscid flow computation program gives stronger moduli of\\nunsteady pressure than does the linear theory, (see Figure 17), but it\\ndifferentiates well between the intrados and the extrados and gives a\\nbetter qualitative representation of the unsteady phenomenon, especial-\\nly In the vicinity of the leading edge and of the hinge. The gain\\nobtained by pairing it with the boundary layer computation is appre-\\nciable: the discrepancy in the unsteady pressure moduli between the\\ninviscid flow computations and the experimental results is reduced by\\nmore than 50%.\\nThe phases are almost unchanged by this pairing, except\\nin the vicinity of the trailing edge.\\nThe advantage of pairing appears even more strongly in\\nFigure 19 which represents a case of strong viscous interaction, with\\nan average flap angle of 5 0: when the flap is angled 5 0 in steady\\nflow, a breakaway occurs at the extrados trailing edge, in the neigh-\\nborhood of x1c \\t 0.95. Calculations for unsteady inviscid flow pro-\\nvide very different results from those obtained experimentally. Pair-\\ning with boundary layer computations reduces, by nearly 70*/g,, the dis-\\ncrepancy between the unsteady pressure moduli and causes the phases to\\nevolve in a forward direction. The paired computation fairly well\\nrepresents the evolution of unsteady pressures along the chord up to\\nabout %/c 0.9 ,, on the extrados a very pronounced phase advance behind\\nthe hinge, and an increase in the moduli of unsteady pressures towards\\nthe trailing edge, can be observed. However, the last ten per cent ofs.\\nthe chord is unrealistic because of the simplified treatment of the\\nbreakaway zone. This results in a lack of exactitude in the quanti-\\ntative values of the moduli and phases of unsteady pressures on the\\nairfoil as a whole. The paired program is thus functioning here at\\nthe limit of its potential.\\nIf we consider the intensity of the unsteady pressures\\nbetween the leading edge and the hinge, for example, (Figures 17 and\\n18), non- linear computation paired with the boundary layer may appear /19-10\\ndisappointing in comparison to the linearized theory which gives a\\nroughly equivalent result, since it benefits from an error, compensation\\nbetween the effects of thickness and curve on one hand, and viscous\\neffects on the other.\\nHowever, by suppressing the infinite values:of the\\nleading edge and the hinge, by giving much better results than those\\nof the linearized theory for the flap, and by being very sensitive to\\nthe average flow parameters, paired non linear computations give\\nresults which are much more satisfactory from the point of view of\\noverall coefficients. This is shown in Figures 20 to 22:\\n- Figure 20 first shows the evolution of the three\\nunsteady coefficients (lift, moment of pitch at 25% and moment of\\nhinge) as a function of the reduced; frequency at N oo = 0.3 in config-\\nurations in which the average angle of the control surface is nil.\\nThe experimental results a :e presented with those of the linear theory\\nand of the BERTIN program with and without boundary layer. The paired\\nprogram gives better results than the linear theory, but it does not\\ngive satisfactory results for the phase of the moment of hinge. It\\nshould however be noted that the experimental determination of the\\nunsteady moment of hinge lacks precision as a result of the limited\\nnumber of pressure gauges on the flap (10 in all) , the one farthest\\ndownstream being located only at x/c= 0.95. In addition, there may be\\na draft between the wing and the control surface which the theory does\\nnot take into consideration.\\n12\\n- the advantage of using the paired,program is still\\nmore apparent in Figure 21, which shows the evolution of the same three\\noverall unsteady coefficients as a function of the average angle of\\nthe control surface for a given reduced frequency at M oa = 0.3. The\\ncoefficients given by the linear theory are constant, since according\\nto the hypothesis the unsteady flow does not depend on l the average\\nflow. The coefficients given by the BERTIN program for inviscid fluids\\nvary very slightly when the average angle of the contxol^surface varies\\nbetween - 100 and + 10 0. On the other hand the unsteady coefficients\\nof lift and moment of pitch given by the paired program are quite\\nclose to the experimental coefficients and evolve in the same way with\\nthe average angle; the modulus decreases more and more quickly as the\\naverage load on the wing increases and the phase evolves in a forward\\ndirection as we approach configurations in which breakaway occurs. It\\nwill be noted, moreover, that the paired computation does not give\\nphases which are different from those of the inviscid flow computations\\nexcept on approaching breakaway configurations, in the vicinity of s,„\\n5°. The paired computation was not pursued beyond 6m= 5\\' cause of\\nthe large extent of the breakaway zones. We may therefore conclude\\nthat the phenomenon of dependericy on the average angle which affects\\nthe unsteady performance of the control surfaces is essentially of\\nviscous origin.\\nAs far as the moment of hinge is concerned, the paired\\ncomputation show\\'s evolution as a function of the average angle to be\\nmore significant than does the inviscid flow computation, but the\\ntheoretical values differ increasingly from the experimental values\\nfor large angles, which can be explained by the reasons already given.\\nApart from this lack of precision on the moment of\\nhinge, the par ied program thus offers a number of ad.vantaes, from the\\npoint of view both of predicting unsteady coefficients, and of pre -\\ndicting average values, as shown in Figure 22 where the average values\\nof the lift coefficient as a function of the average angle of the\\ncontrol surface are shown.\\n13\\nIn order to attempt an oXplanaLion of the discrepancies\\nnoted between the eXperiMeatal results and those of the paired program,\\nA should be remembered that the boundary layer was presumed to be\\nentirely turbulent from a point arbitrarily located about; \\tfrom the\\nleading edge. In addition, the test results have not been corrected\\nfor the wall Int-e-i-rovence.\\n3.3.2 High Subsonic and SUPorefiLiCal Zone\\nThe linear theory being incapable of anticipating the\\nexistence of shocks, only comparisons with the CARADONNA program for\\nSmall transonic diKurbaacos will be considered.\\nIm suporcri t teal rogbuo, the position of Cho shocks\\nis a crucial point, and is strongly influenced by the Wall\\nThis is why the computations woro enrriod out at an 00\"o1; co nad WWI\\nnj^.mbon: corrected for the steady * wall effect, the only one which call\\npresently be estimated With Validity, III guided jet,, this\\tWall\\neffect can be assimilated with a Mach number Correction and eou Id be\\nestimmod correctly as can be scow in the steady computations (Figures\\n13 to 16).

These singularities are located farther downstream than in\\nthe experiments, but they are much better placed and the order of\\nsize of the unsteady pressure moduli is more correct when the boundary\\nlayer is taken into account.\\nHowever, when the shock occurs at less than 30% from\\nthe leading edge, either by inviscid flow computations (Figure 24) or\\nbecause of the boundary layer (Figures 24 and 25) it Loses its charac-\\nter of singularity and gives rise to an insignificant maximum on the\\nmoduli. This is perhaps attributable to the fact that the method of\\nsmall disturbances lacks precision at the leading edge, especially\\nfor a 16% airfoil.\\nFor the guided jet example (Figure 26) at an already\\t/19-13\\nlarge Mach number and reduced frequency, even though the Mach number\\ncorrection was satisfactorily estimated according to calculations\\ncarried out for steady flow (Figures 13 to 16), the present paired\\ncomputations bring the shock forward a little too much, while the\\norder of size of the unsteady pressures remains correct. Where the\\nphase is concerned, as the inviscid flow, in this case, already gives\\n15\\ninsufficient delay at the leading edge, the boundary layer accentuates\\nthis descrepancy by reducing the size of the supersonic zone, the\\nsource of the delay. Upstream from the shock, the boundary layer\\nacts as it doev, at Moo * 0.6, bringing about a fairly significant\\nphase delay.\\nFigure 27 summarizes, for several examples, the averiage\\nvalue, Lhe amplitude of variation and the phase of lift, both experi-\\nmental kind theoretical, with and without: boundary layer.\\n4. Conclusion\\nThis study shows that in many cases, the unsteady aerodynamic\\nresponse due to a movement of Lhe control surface depends to a large,\\ndegree on the conditions of the average flow over the airfoil and\\ncontrol surface as a unit. It seems that this phenomenon is clue\\nlargely to viscosity. The use of linear theories to preduct unsteady\\naerodynamic responses is therefore in fact very limited, and it: is\\nnecessary to have recourse to non-linear inviscid flow methods which\\nshould be paired with a boundary layer calculation.\\nIn this respect the results of the first attempts at pairing are\\nencouraging. However, it is necessary to have the inviscid flow\\nmethod which is as exact as Possible, ;Nlithout forgetting the com-\\npromise between the desired precision and speed of calculation. In\\naddition progress remains to be made in pairing techniques, espeically\\nwhere the treatment of breakaway zones and shock wave-boundary layer\\ninteractions are concerned. Finally, an effort should be made to\\nLake into account, either experimentally or by calculation, the un-A\\nsteady boundary effects.\\nP on MMAN\\n2\\tS^ Maw* T PLAN\\nC\"twvip domciWian d\\'atom\\n6 NqLMKO IftW* 14 W W\\n41,\\tCWOWI i do i pmsmm\\nCm I kmm do *\"I\"414AW\\nKey: 1.
